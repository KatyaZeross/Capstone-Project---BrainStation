14,brothers,15.55,19.5,24.26,5.2,0.95,8.96,9.66,0.0,15.92,2733.0," captains log stardate  due to a medical emergency we have been forced to cut short a twoday liberty on ogus two and set course for starbase fouronesix,  it seems a young mans practical joke has come dangerously close to a lethal conclusion,  well mister potts why dont we start at the beginning,  it was a joke sir i just meant to scare him,  from the beginning please,  we were at the arcade sir i brought this balloon with me filled with red pillion dye you see willie is always making fun of me i figured id get him back i only meant to scare him,  slow down jake,  we programmed the game for an ordinary laser duel you know twentyone points four points for a,  im familiar with the game go on,  we went out to the forest behind the east arcade i told willie that his laser pistol looked kind of funny almost like a real one when i went behind the trees i put the balloon into my vest and then,  so you made your nine yearold brother think he killed you,  yes sir,  and then he ran away,  and while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm,  it was just a joke i didnt,  i assume you are aware of the infectious nature of the parasites which inhabit cove palms,  i am now sir,  are you familiar with the condition upon which i agreed to allow you two boys to remain on the enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical,  that wed stay out of trouble sir,  mister data think about it mister potts and while youre at it think about what might have happened had we not been this close to a starbase medical facility,  have you contacted the boys parents,  they are fully aware of the situation sir,  good escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom perhaps hell be helpful in lifting his brothers spirits,  yes sir,  please dont think that you have heard the last of this mister potts,  no sir i mean yes sir,  hes very frightened,  as well he should be ive never been a proponent of practical jokes more often than not they have unfortunate results,  i wouldnt be surprised if this was his last practical joke for a long while,  im more concerned with his brothers future at the moment counselor,  our sickbay does have the facility to isolate parasitic protoviruses but not in a favorable time frame for your brother,  he really could die,  fortunately we are only two days from starbase fouronesix and their laboratory can,  can what sir,  their laboratory can do what commander,  sir i know i made a mistake i can tell youre angry but if youre not going to talk to me,  back so soon mister data,  la forge to bridge,  go ahead commander,  weve completed our dilithium vector calibrations sir youre clear to increase to warp seven,  very good geordi let me know if you,  captain did you request a course correction,  sir i didnt say we could increase speed to warp ninepoint one,  new course set for heading threefourone mark twotwoone,  course set by whom,  not me commander,  whats going on,  data who programmed the new coordinates,  warp ninepointthree sir,  i dont advise this captain if were going to maintain the realignment progression we shouldnt be pushing more than warp eight for at least an hour,  commander,  evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in fifteen seconds,  turbolifts three and four gentlemen geordi transfer helm to engineering,  aye sir,  evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in ten seconds,  reassemble in engineering la forge lets get a diagnostic sweep underway,  evacuate bridge deck one life support failure in five seconds,  deck one life support has been terminated,  our velocity is holding steady at warp ninepointthree do you wish to override commander,  not yet computer isolate cause of life support failure,  atmosphere conditioning pumps on deck one are operating in negative mode,  how could that be there are seven independent safety interlocks to prevent that,  sir i think weve found the problem but it doesnt really make sense,  it seems we have more than one problem bring the enterprise to a full stop commander,  full stop ensign kopf,  its not responding sir,  i ordered all helm control transferred down here damn it,  we did sir weve been waiting for your instructions,  im going to have to do this at the manual input level sir,  wes,  were still on the altered heading captain holding at warp nine point three,  force fields have been established on all main bridge turbolift doors and service crawlways sir,  computer locate lieutenant commander data,  commander data is on the main bridge,  what the hell is he up to,  number one take a security team up to deck two see if you can break through from below,  everythings locked up captain no control of impulse or warp engines down here,  navigation doesnt respond either sir,  picard to bridge commander data do you hear me,  i repeat data do you hear,  computer recognize data lieutenant commander alpha one clearance,  priority clearance recognition alpha one,  maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspace communications,  acknowledged,  he is on the bridge sir,  commander la forge prepare for saucer separation,  sir were at warp ninethree,  im aware of the risks ensign when the umbilical splits we should regain primary control do you agree,  yes sir,  prepared to sweep back and pull it in with a tractor beam,  aye sir,  initiate auto sequence,  computer recognize picard jean luc alpha two clearance,  priority clearance recognition alpha two,  cancel separation sequence,  sequence cancelled,  isolate all remaining command functions and accept related orders and inquiries from main bridge only,  the separation sequence has been aborted captain,  computer recognize jeanluc picard alpha two priority and reestablish separation procedures immediately,  orders regarding command functions are no longer accepted from your present location,  and just what location are they accepted from,  interface terminals on main bridge only,  youre the only one who has clearance to localize command functions sir,  it seems mister data has acquired them as well,  the isolinear subprocessor extends threepointfive meters,  ive got a clear path to panel jbaker whats that going to do for us,  jbaker backs onto science station two commander,  have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer,  yes sir life support has been reestablished,  then you and casey get up here lets get to it,  computer configure a perimeter field charge sections ninek through twelvet,  what the hell was that,  hes activated a force field sir,  great just great,  chief obrien,  yes captain,  you had better disable the site tosite transport function when we get to wherever were going i dont want him beaming off the bridge,  ill get right to it sir,  doctor crusher,  yes captain,  is your quarantine intact doctor,  sickbay force fields dont seem to have been affected,  the boy,  hes alright but hes not going to stay alright sir we need to get this ship to a starbase medical facility,  it seems doctor that mister data has other plans for the enterprise right now,  cmon i cant believe that everybodys played a practical joke at one time or another,  not me,  not even a little one how about april fools are you telling me youve never tried to pull something on april fools day,  what for its never funny to the one getting fooled,  well im sure your brother didnt intend this to get out of hand,  certainly not to the degree it has take a deep breath,  whats so funny about making someone think you killed them,  a deep breath,  have you been drinking all the water i asked you to,  yes,  well keep it up we may have a short delay in reaching the starbase and i want you,  there you see how can i tell him if hes not going to listen to me,  why dont you try jake,  its just a waste of time he wont listen,  computer prepare to transport me directly to the following coordinates,  sitetosite transport interlocks have been manually deactivated,  can you override,  negative,  show me the shortest route to transporter room one,  computer prepare to activate a cascade force field sequence in the following progression,  no matter what we try the computer will only acknowledge commands from the bridge sir,  hes blocked every subspace channel captain we cant even call for help,  have you tried tracing back navigation inputs,  we dont even know what star system were in sir,  the only way we knew wed come out of warp was by looking out a window,  obrien to captain picard,  go ahead chief,  captain hes up to something,  what now,  he discovered the sitetosite lockout i wouldnt be surprised if he tries to make it to a transporter room now,  how much further can you safely disable the ransporters mister obrien,  im afraid ive done all i can sir as soon as he realized we had knocked out the primary power bus he put up force fields around the secondaries i dont recommend anyone going near those circuits now,  i want security teams along the main passageways and in every transporter oom lieutenant see if the computer would be good enough to give you the specific stun setting to disable mister data,  computer estimate time from this location to starbase fouronesix at warp nine,  inquiries regarding command functions are no longer accepted from your present location,  computer establish a security code for access to all functions previously transferred to bridge,  enter code,  four one three three six eight tango one eight one one seven one charlie four victor three eight eight eight zero foxtrot six one five three three five nine five seven lock,  security code intact for all specified inquiries and orders,  computer initiate cascade sequence accepting instructions from commander data en route now,  hes out security team approaching location,  intersection eightj aftport establish,  i order you to stop,  computer begin scanphase,  no its too close,  this has gone far enough data,  computer threemeter crossseal,  i wouldnt advise that sir the phase coils dont take well to ricochets,  whats he doing,  hes reactivating the sitetosite transport interlocks,  does that mean hell be able to,  great,  the force field only seems to go across the front of the pad sir security should be able to cut through from behind,  youre right on time,  open,  one of these,  and one of these,  and,  there we are,  i fail to recall how i arrived here,  i sent for you in a manner of speaking,  data to enterprise,  enterprise do you read me,  i always loved that face please sit down,  we were headed for a medical facility i was taking the boys brother to sickbay and,  im sure your starship will be back for you soon please sit,  i must find a way to contact the enterprise,  tell me do i look somewhat familiar to you,  you do bear a resemblance to doctor noonian soong the cyberneticist who constructed me but doctor soong was killed shortly afterward by the crystalline entity,  its your lucky day data youve found your long lost father and hes alive what do you think of that,  but the colony was destroyed there were no survivors,  it is really you,  indulge an old man and stand on one leg for me,  please,  excellent you know before i activated your positronic net i had the damnedest time working out those fluidic equilibrium circuits,  perhaps you could help me contact my ship,  if you cant raise them with your communicator what can i do its alright you can put it down,  theyll be back for you im certain trust me now tell me how are you at differentiating between a humid day and a dry one,  the moisture content of the ships atmosphere is maintained at a moderate thirtyseven percent,  no no not your ship when youre on land a planet,  i can differentiate between varying hygrometric levels,  without some sort of external sensor,  what then whats the difference,  between humid and dry,  humid air feels different against my skin sir and it carries smells differently i assume this is due to the fact that moisture,  how wonderful i tried so hard to get that right its very important you know,  may i ask why you have brought me here,  i incorporated an encoded homing circuit into your sublogic controller,  your response refers to how you brought me here not why,  havent you missed me data,  i suppose thats impossible,  i assumed you dead sir,  well my longevity isnt the only surprise i have in store for you data,  the quarantine field in sickbay sir,  you have access to it,  when he transferred force field control to the bridge he must have only specified fields he was planning to initiate the quarantine field was already operating,  under normal circumstances we could divert that field energy and use it to cancel the force field protecting the bridge but we have to retain the medical quarantine,  determine the absolute minimum field energy that doctor crusher needs and use the rest to get me onto my bridge,  how are you feeling this morning,  not so great im having trouble standing up i get sorta dizzy,  you know the old story about the man who tells his doctor it hurts when i raise my arm like this,  the doctor says then dont raise your arm like that,  so if i get dizzy standing up,  dont stand up,  okay doc were ready if all goes well you shouldnt notice a thing,  make sure all goes well commander,  your brother says you still wont speak to him,  so,  this is very hard on him too he feels very guilty about what happened hes your brother,  why is everybody so worried about him im the one whos sick im the one whos gonna die,  nobodys going to die willie do you hear me nobody,  captain we are in,  were on our way lieutenant,  computer restore tactical station,  deactivation of command function overrides requires alpha two clearance,  beverly thinks its going to be tight lets hope he didnt take us too far off course,  lets hope,  it wont answer to my clearance sir,  computer this is captain picard return all command functions to stations,  alpha two clearance recognized please enter security code,  security code,  i was afraid of something like that,  sensors are operative,  well at least thats something what have you got,  no fix on data but i am picking up a single lifeform on the surface sir it appears human,  thats one human whos got the answers to a lot of questions,  something else sir,  what is it,  a small vessel entering orbit i detect no lifeforms aboard,  good good keep it up ah huh,  old tom handy swore youd never master that whistle,  ive been able to keep track of you from time to time youve become somewhat of a celebrity in cybernetic circles why starfleet,  sir,  i gave you the ability to choose whatever you wanted to do whatever you wanted why starfleet,  it was starfleet officers who rescued me,  ah so you decided to emulate your emancipators how disappointing,  what choice of vocation would have met with your approval,  i often hoped you might become a scientist perhaps a cyberneticist,  to follow in your footsteps as it were,  i see  nothing wrong with that,  may i ask you a question sir,  certainly anything youd like,  why did you create me,  why does a painter paint why does a boxer box you know what michelangelo used to say the sculptures he made were already there before he started hidden in the marble all he had to do was remove the unneeded bits it wasnt quite that easy with you data but the need to do it my need to do it was no different than michelangelos need now let me ask you a question,  why are humans so fascinated with old things,  old things,  old buildings churches walls ancient things antique things tables clocks knick knacks why,  there are many possible explanations,  if you brought a noophian to earth hed look around and say tear that old village down its hanging in rags build me something new something efficient but to a human that ancient wall that old house is a shrine something to cherish again i ask you why,  perhaps for humans old things represent a tie to the past,  and whats so important about the past people needed money they got sick why tie yourself to that,  humans are mortal they seem to need a sense of continuity,  ah hah why,  to give their lives meaning a sense of purpose,  and does this continuity only run one way back into the past,  i suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate,  so you believe that having children gives humans a sense of immortality do you,  it is a reasonable explanation to your query sir,  and perhaps to yours as well data,  it appears we have a visitor,  lore,  well well it seems weve got ourselves a family reunion,  doctor i implore you please do not reactivate him,  dont be ridiculous data open,  lore is far from the maniacal android you have made him out to be in any case hell obey me he always did,  but he admitted to an alliance with the crystal entity to gain its favor he betrayed the colonists and would have betrayed the enterprise as well had i not,  hold still,  there one more,  im well aware of lores shortcomings remember it was i who deactivated him,  and as i have explained it was i who was responsible for his reactivation but it serves no purpose to make the same mistake twice,  in science data making the same mistake twice is often not a mistake at all quite the contrary,  that should do it,  so youre still alive im surprised you woke me why didnt you just take me apart and be done with it that is why the two of you captured me,  data had nothing to do with this lore and no one captured you not exactly that is you see both of your brains contain a simple homing device datas was activated purposefully yours well until you walked in that door i didnt know you had ever been reassembled,  no thanks to you,  but thanks to you dear brother i spent nearly two years drifting in space if it hadnt been for a fortunate encounter with a pakled trade ship id still be out there,  i had no alternative you would have destroyed the enterprise,  well since i appear to be an uninvited guest at your little party ill leave you with your beloved son and be on my way,  no wait stay here there are questions i can answer youll have no chance to ask them later you see im dying,  dying from what sir,  wait a minute wait a minute what do you mean youre dying you look fine youre not that old you look fine what is this some kind of trick to see how wed react,  i wish it were,  we have control of sensors life support and auxiliary power captain nothing more,  the code mister la forge,  we cant even locate the file address at least that would tell us how many digits were talking about not that it would really help,  i want something that will really help,  and quickly willie potts has twentyfour hours thirtysix tops if it goes longer than that the only thing starbase fouronesix will have left to do is a postmortem,  geordi if the computers programmed to allow data to transport down it would figure that it would allow him to beam back up right,  it would figure,  and data left a trace imprint when he beamed down,  everyone does,  so what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding a way to make the computer think someone else is data maybe a few someone elses,  wed have to access the transport controller and reset it to a testing mode convince it that its back in school accepting simulated inputs its going to be tough without the main computer but we could network a few tricorders together,  try mister la forge,  you did what you had to do what kind of answer is that,  the only one i can give you you were not lore told me the colonists became envious of him because you made him so completely human,  i wouldnt exactly have used the word envious,  you disassembled me took me apart and so soon after you had put me together you gave me no chance,  lore also said the colonists petitioned you to replace him with a less perfect android,  the last thing you should think of yourself as data is less perfect the two of you are virtually identical except for a bit of programming,  it was a lie another lie,  i would have proven to you that i was worthy if you had given me the chance but it was easier to turn your back and build your precious data,  you were the first you meant as much to me as data ever did but you were unstable the colonists werent envious of you they were afraid of you you were unstable,  i am not less perfect than lore,  why didnt you try to fix me it was within your power to fix me,  it wasnt as easy as that the next logical step was to construct data afterward i planned to get back to you to fix you but i never got that chance,  i am not less perfect than lore,  enough sit down both of you,  for all these years ive been plagued by what went wrong with all the complexities you possessed the nuances basic emotion seemed almost simple in comparison but the emotion turned and twisted and became entangled with ambition lore if i had known you were no longer sitting in pieces on a distant shelf if i had known i could push a button and bring you here i would have spent those years trying to make things right for you as well but all i knew of was data so i worked long and hard and now i believe ive succeeded,  this is why i brought you here basic emotions data simple feelings your feelings,  ive imagined how hard its been for you living amongst beings so moved by emotion,  i dont have to imagine i know how hard its been but youll be surprised data feelings do funny things you may even learn to understand your evil brother to forgive him we will be more alike you and i youll see im happy for you,  i question your sincerity lore,  perhaps with this youll learn to be more trusting data your brother has had good reason to be bitter,  but sir lore was responsible for,  he wasnt given the chance you and i were given to live but now im sure he understands why i had to do what i did if there was only time left i could help you as well what a shame the procedure is quite simple but ill need to rest first im tired,  and after the procedure what then,  i assume data will return to his ship and you to yours,  no youll need someone to care for you i will remain,  i need to rest now,  may i assist you with the procedure,  its a simple insertion no need,  theyre sure this is going to work,  nobody knows the transporters better than obrien and la forge they tell me theyve managed more than a little sleight of hand with our authorization codes,  and they can insert them into the recall loop,  the computer should think all three of us are data,  lets just hope we dont all beam back looking like data,  whenever you say sir,  bring him home number one,  energize,  data,  the sons of the prophet were valiant and bold and quite unaccustomed to fear but of all the most reckless or so i am told was abdul abulbul amir,  how do you feel,  ive always loved that ditty i could never quite get the cadence down before thanks father,  you called me father,  would you prefer i call you often wrong,  what did lore tell you about that,  oftenwrong soong that is what the colonists called you isnt it a very sloppy rhyme,  wrong soong wrong soong no doesnt work lets see,  data tell me how youre feeling,  oftenwrongs got a broken heart cant even tell his boys apart,  lore,  well well youre not quite as feeble as i thought,  this wont work those circuits they werent designed for you,  wheres data,  wheres data you didnt fill data with substandard parts that honor was bestowed upon me remember you owe me old man not him me,  youre not listening to me it was not meant for you it must be removed,  nice try oftenwrong,  im not quite sure what its doing but its doing something,  i didnt know you were alive if i had,  there were brave men a plenty all well known to fame who served in the ranks of the czar,  the human is there,  and data,  no way of knowing,  on stun,  worf,  its all right take it easy,  look at this stuff im telling you its soong,  im commander william riker of the starship enterprise,  here let me,  do you mind telling me whats going on here,  he surprised me he rendered me unconscious what happened,  who surprised you,  so alike i couldnt tell you apart hes gone back to his ship i think there was only one chip yours i tried to tell him not enough time to build another,  who went back to his ship damn it data whats going on,  lore sir he was inadvertently summoned here by the same signal which activated my homing circuitry it seems that after two years in interstellar space he was,  mister data weve got a very sick boy on the enterprise whos not getting any better and were dead in the water until you get us out of here,  its all right access your third nested memory file and execute instruction fiveonefivefive it will clear your memory block,  i was unaware of the inconvenience i have caused sir,  well discuss it later youre coming too doctor you need to get to sickbay,  no no no ill be fine,  with all due respect sir you dont look fine to me,  ive lived here a long time young man i have no plans of dying anywhere else,  but sir our medical facility could most likely,  go data go with your friends,  may i say goodbye to doctor soong sir,  alone sir,  everybody dies data,  do you believe in some ways we are alike,  in many ways id like to believe,  then it is alright for you to die because i will remain alive,  you know i cannot grieve for you,  you will in your own way goodbye data,  goodbyefather,  captains log stardate 9 we have been at starbase fouronesix for three days young willie potts is responding well to treatment and has been returned to the enterprise,  the transfer went well,  hell remain in quarantine for another week or two but hes out of the woods,  yes captain the boys appear to have reconciled their differences,  theyre brothers data brothers forgive",8
57,hide and q,29.24,17.77,6.57,2.33,2.04,2.13,7.59,32.33,0.0,3427.0," include a burn unit with each kit on arrival identify the most critically injured and beam them up to cargo bay six,  doctor crusher this is the captain,  doctor crusher here,  additional information the number of colonists at the site is five hundredfour  including thirtyeight children,  so far nothing more than the initial message explosion  cause unknown  many injured are you prepared doctor,  we believe so sir,  captain we are now at warp nine point one,  which will bring us into the quadra sigma system in three point two hours,  captain i have a schematic of the explosion site it suggests the cause as a methanelike gas seeping in underground,  captain i am,  i am sensing what we encountered months ago,  the q entity sir it is identical to the grid we encountered when,  it reads solid sir if we hit it ,  not now damn it q emergency full stop,  yes sir,  shields and deflectors up sir,  now reading full stop sir,  humans i thought by now you would have scampered back to your own little star system,  if this is q im addressing our vessel and crew are on a mission of rescue where a group of badly injured,  we of the q have studied our recent contact with you and are impressed we have much to discuss including perhaps the realization of your most impossible dreams,  however intriguing we may find that to be we are now in the midst of an urgent journey once we have completed that,  you will abandon that mission captain my business with you takes precedence,  if my magnificence blinds you then perhaps something more familiar,  damn the phasers are useless,  q stop this,  stop this and we agree to talk for a moment,  starfleet admiral q at your service,  you are not a starfleet admiral q,  neither am i an aldebaran serpent captain but you accepted me as such,  hes got us there captain,  the redoubtable commander riker whom i noticed before you seem to find this amusing,  i might if we werent trying to rescue a group of suffering and dying humans who,  your species is always suffering and dying,  no lieutenant worf ,  youll make no move against him unless i order it,  pity you might have learned an interesting lesson tsk a macro head a micro brain,  q you said you had the realization of some impossible dreams to offer us once this rescue is complete ill listen seriously to whatever proposal you wish to make and then subject to it being acceptable,  human values picard why do you people distrust me so,  sir if,  yes captain it is best they dont answer that but you you picard i grant the freedom to answer me honestly why do you distrust me so,  q right now humans may be dying because you,  speak why do you distrust me,  why on our first meeting q you seized my vessel condemned all humans as savages and on that charge you tried us in a postatomic twentyfirst century court of horrors where you attacked my people then you again seized my vessel,  how that angers you seized my vessel seized my vessel ,  with our farpoint mission threatening to convict us as ignorant savages if in dealing with complex and powerful lifeforms we made the slightest error and when you failed even there,  at that point the q became interested in you cannot some of you understand your incredible good fortune seized my vessel seized my vessel  the complaint of a closed mind too accustomed to military privileges but you riker and i remember you well what do you make of my offer,  i stand with my captain,  of course you do commendable loyalty and what of these others since humanity now interests us how shall we come to know them better,  we dont have time for these games,  ah yes a game for interests sake a deadly game to the game,  obviously a classm world gravity and oxygen within our limits,  considering the power demonstrated by q the last time anywhere assuming this place even exists,  but this wont be boring if qs anything hes imaginative apparently the captain wasnt meant to be with us here,  sir over here ,  join me riker a good game needs rules and planning,  wasnt it your own hartley who said nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it plays almost right actually you reveal yourselves best in how you play,  sir what he has in mind could provide us with vital information,  what i sense is pleasure sir,  incredible i was just thinking of an oldfashioned lemonade,  excellent thirst quencher it becomes quite hot out on this plane,  what about my people,  whatever they want of course,  the rigid klingon code drink not with thine enemy which explains something of why you defeated them,  still arguing the human past perhaps youre not that original,  au contraire it is the human future that now intrigues us and should concern you most of all species yours cannot abide stagnation change is at the heart of what you are but change into what thats the question,  that is what humans call a truism,  meaning hardly original,  youre the one who said it and while were at it true i borrowed this from your stodgy captains mind it is dressing for the game we will play and games require boundaries dangers rewards familiar settings that sort of thing,  its not that familiar to me data,  it is from europes napoleonic era sir late eighteenth early nineteenth centuries this is a campaign headquarters tent his uniform is that of a french army marshal the,  and a marshal outranks even an admiral,  would i go from a starfleet admiral to anything less,  of course you wouldnt but napoleonic equipment on an alien planet with dual suns ,  as youve said im nothing if not imaginative and the game should reflect that shall it be a test of strength meaningless since you have none a test of intelligence equally meaningless a game needs risk something to win something to lose,  if we must play a game what would we win,  the greatest possible future you can imagine which of course requires something totally disastrous if you lose the point of this game will be whether any of you can stay alive,  if your game is fair we will,  for shame lieutenant worf fairness is a human concept think imaginatively it will in fact be completely unfair,  youve gone too far,  game penalty,  where is she q you can forget your game if,  to use a twentieth century term commander shes in a a penalty box where she can remain unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty unfortunately there is only one penalty box if any of you should be sent there dear tasha must give up the box to you,  and where does she go,  into nothingness i entreat you to carefully obey the rules of the game the only one who can destroy your tasha now is you,  turbolift control do you read this is the captain,  engineering this is the bridge,  security  this is the captain,  computer computer on,  captains log,  damn i cant even make a log entry,  i wish i could help you captain,  what what are you doing here,  i well this sounds strange but im in the penalty box,  youre what,  in qs penalty box as i said it sounds strange but it definitely isnt somehow i know that one more penalty by me or anyone and im gone,  gone,  please do not keep reminding me,  im sorry,  no im sorry its so frustrating to be controlled like this,  lieutenanttasha its all right,  what the hell am i doing crying,  dont worry theres a new ships standing order when in a penalty box some tears are permitted,  captain if you werent a captain,  consorting with lower rank females captain,  destructive to discipline they say but you are after all only human eh,  a marshal of france ridiculous,  one takes what jobs he can get for example your log entries starship log stardate today this is q speaking for captain jeanluc picard who we consider too bound by starfleet custom and tradition to be useful in this activity,  but who proved himself a resourceful opponent when he defeated you at farpoint,  the enterprise is now helpless stuck like an earth insect in amber while its bridge crew plays out a game whose real intent officer is worthy of the greatest gift the q can offer,  so youre taking on riker this time excellent hell defeat you just as i did,  a wager on that captain your command of this starship against ,  against your staying out of humanitys path forever done,  done and youve already lost picard you see riker is to be offered something impossible to reject,  geordi can you still see worf,  id see the freckles on his nose if he had them sir hes at the third ridge now,  the third ridge ,  moving well oh oh good he sees them they look like sentries sir,  q listen to me you seem to have some need of humans,  or concern regarding them,  whichever it is why try to solve it through this confrontation with us why not a simple direct explanation a statement of what you seek why these games,  im surprised you have to ask when your human shakespeare has already explained it so well,  indeed he did q but careful you dont depend too much on any single viewpoint he,  why these games i require of you a pity youre not familiar with the contents of your own library hear this picard and reflect all the galaxy all the worlds a stage ,  oh you know that one then how about  lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing,  and so you say how we respond to a game tells you more about us than our real life a tale told by an idiot interesting q,  shall i quote from hamlet,  no i know hamlet and what he said with irony i prefer to say with conviction what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god ,  you dont really see your species like that,  i see us one day becoming that q is that what concerns you,  can you still see worf,  its hard to keep him in sight sir but the soldiers there theyve formed a skirmishing line i think youd call it and theyre headed this way,  carrying ancient powder and ball muskets,  thats what their weapons look like sir,  muskets are appropriate to the but it is hardly a weapon by our standards sir a lead ball propelled by gunpowder  onehundred meters at most with any accuracy,  against phasers just one of our hand phasers could finish off an entire regiment of them,  drop your weapons,  im afraid it was me worf making certain our phasers still operate,  a warriors reaction,  incredible worf you came out of nowhere,  report what did you find,  sir what theyre wearing may be old earth uniforms but whats inside those uniforms isnt human at all more like vicious animal things,  oh oh good old q but how can even the most savage animal forms threaten us if theyre armed with the equivalent of popguns,  theyre moving in fast sir,  data if youve got a theory on whats happening,  think fast commander riker and move fast ,  thats no musket,  troi geordi worf ,  you have only one chance to save them now send them to your ship,  youll let me beam them,  send them the same way as i do ive given you that power,  use your power,  take the conn lieutenant,  engineering  this is the bridge,  engineering here sir,  are all systems back on line,  back on line sir they were never off,  captain you had better look at this,  there has been no interruption in course or speed both have remained constant captain  its as though we never stopped,  we never did q suspended time,  wheres commander riker,  he was with us,  he must still be on the planet we were under attack by by animal things,  animal things,  animal things in uniform sir which i think data could probably explain better sir,  you may find it aesthetically displeasing sir i could just file a computer report on that,  sir the important thing right now is why is commander riker missing,  understood counselor but will is almost certainly safe sense q has an interest in him in fact qs entire visit has something to do with our first officer,  and the reason for that sir ,  i wish i knew q became interested in him at farpoint ive no idea what it means meanwhile we must proceed with our rescue mission,  something amuses you,  the joke is you you silly son of a bitch,  strange gratitude from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream how can you not appreciate being able to send your friends back to their ship the nothingness from which they came,  certainly you understand that at this moment you can send yourself back to your ship or to earth or change your shape and become anything else you want to be,  need,  you want something from us q desperately what is it,  want something from you foolish fragile nonentities careful riker youre beginning to sound like your captain,  now thats a compliment q but its not an answer,  riker we have tried to offer you a gift beyond all other gifts ,  after farpoint i returned to where we exist the q continuum,  which means exactly what,  the limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist we could hardly be capable of acting in ways that seem so astonishing to you if we were limited to the primitive dimensions in which you live dimensions which would make us prisoners of time and space,  what do you mean by we,  in our continuum the terms we and i mean much the same,  i dont understand,  of course you dont and you never will until you become one of us,  until would you mind going over that again,  if youll stop interrupting me this really isnt the time to teach you the true nature of the universe at farpoint we saw you as savages only and thought to frighten you into scurrying back to your system we discovered instead that you are an unusual creature in your own limited ways ways which in time may not be so limited,  were growing something about us compels us to learn explore,  the human compulsion and unfortunately for us a force that will grow stronger century after century eon after eon,  eons have you any idea how far well advance,  perhaps in a future you cannot yet conceive even beyond us and so we must know more about the human condition we have selected you riker to become part of the q to bring that human need and hunger to us so that we may understand it,  i suppose you mean that as a compliment q or maybe its my limited mind youre going to miss me,  oh no,  come on not again,  whats happening commander riker i was sitting in school,  my phasers gone worf are you armed,  where is q if you have any answer to this number one,  worf,  no damn it damn it to hell ,  riker you you did that,  and thats not all,  that grid their wounds only the q could do that,  captains log stardate 9 twelve minutes out from quadra sigma iii where the survivors of an underground disaster desperately need our help aboard the enterprise,  needs help nearly as badly but this is a subject so far out of my experience out of any humans experience,  will how the hell do i advise you what to do,  no one has ever offered to turn you into god,  dont joke with me what the q has offered you has got to be close to immortality will theyre not lying about controlling space and time weve seen it in what they can do but,  youve also seen it in what i can do,  of all things that troubles me most will are you strong enough to refuse to use that power,  certainly,  no matter how tempted no matter how difficult q makes it,  you have my word,  in orbit of quadra sigma iii sir ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area,  this way,  you are going to be all right now,  where are the others,  gone its just us,  commander,  theres someone there,  shes dead if wed only gotten here a little sooner ,  sir if you indeed have qs power,  i dont understand can you bring her back to life,  no,  as soon as its convenient captain i insist on a meeting with you and your staff,  as soon as we are secure from the rescue operation well meet in the conference room,  thank you,  counselor,  power  immense frightening i cant read the intent  but there is terrible anger in him,  well confer on the bridge here if no one,  the bridge is fine since ive called the entire staff,  correction number one knowing the decision you face ive permitted you this gathering,  of course jeanluc,  this meeting isnt for you wesley,  all right he stays the first thing hell hear is because ive been given unusual powers im not suddenly a monster except for those abilities and i dont yet know how far they go im the same william t riker youve always known,  well everyone still looks uncomfortable,  perhaps were all remembering the old saying power corrupts ,  absolutely do you believe i havent thought of that jeanluc,  and have you noticed that you and i are now on a firstname basis,  will something has happened to you already,  in what way havent you seen how much ive regretted not saving that child captain using the q power to save her might not have been wrong no more than it was wrong to save the rest of you from those soldier things,  lets keep in mind that particular danger was invented by q,  what we represent to the q will are lowly animals tormented into performing for their amusement,  actually they think highly of us troi we have a quality of of growth which they admire,  or fear,  number one weve learned that the q power does not admire us q has muddled your mind somehow,  its your mind that troubles me captain dont you understand his incredible gift to me,  are these truly your friends brother,  let us pray for understanding for compassion for,  let us do no such damned thing what is this need of yours for costumes have you no identity of your own,  i come in search of truth,  you come in search of what humanity is,  i forgive your blasphemy,  cant you see it number one hes nothing but a flimflam man thats what hes been since his first appearance at farpoint,  flimflam,  you offer riker jealousy what i offer him is clearly beyond your comprehension how can you claim friendship for riker while obstructing his way to the greatest adventure ever offered a human,  obstruct him then its not yet certain hes not yet committed,  the truly evil part of this is your jealousy captain you love each one of your people demonstrate it you have the power to leave each of them with a gift proving your affection,  thered be no harm would there if i if i gave them something i know theyd like,  how touching a plea to his former captain may i please give some happiness to my friends sir please sir,  in fact i authorize and support that idea riker and please cooperate with him if you wish,  are you certain sir if,  im quite certain counselor by all means demonstrate your gifts of affection,  remarkable he rises now above jealousy,  dont be frightened there is no way i could harm any one of you shall i guess your dreams,  leave now wesley,  no wesley i may know best of all our friendship our long talks,  no please ,  have your favorite wish my young friend,  hey wes youve grown into a very good looking guy,  data,  its what youve always wanted data to become human,  yes sir that is true but i never wanted to compound one illusion with another it might seem real to q  even you sir but it would not be so to me was it not one of the captains favorite authors who wrote this above all to thine own self be true sorry commander i must decline,  well my friend i know what you want welcome to the wonderful world of vision,  youre as beautiful as i imagined and more,  then we can throw the visor away,  i think not sir the price is a little high for me i dont like who i would have to thank i can still steer the ship with this,  if you accept this new you wesley youll lose wonderful times so many important experiences,  and worf who wants nothing,  except honor and my duty fulfilled,  proud warrior worf without a single tie to his own kind,  no she is from a world now alien to me i have no place in my life for this now,  mister riker if its because your mother objects,  no id just like to get there on my own honest,  how did you know sir i feel like such such an idiot,  quite right you should,  but it was such a pleasure to have been able to do those things,  its all over q you have no further business here,  human you have just destroyed yourself ,  but only after youve paid off your wager q,  i recall no wager,  im sure your fellow q remember you agreed to never trouble our species again just as theyre aware youve failed to tempt a human to join you so q i strongly suspect you have some explaining of your own to do,  extraordinary q sought to discover the distinguishing characteristic of humanity and never learned what coleridge said it must be the possession of a soul within us that makes the difference,  sir we show the same hole in time again our instruments say weve just now beamed up from our rescue mission,  how can the q handle time and space so well and us so badly,  perhaps well discover some day that time and space are simpler than the human equation no coordinates laid in number one,  uh yes sir you have my coordinates mister la forge,  zerozeroeight mark threethreenine sir,  engage",7
71,liaisons,62.44,6.72,1.78,10.62,17.24,0.95,0.26,0.0,0.0,2308.0," enter,  worf theyre going to be here any minute,  i am having problems,  if i didnt know you better id say you were procrastinating,  klingons do not procrastinate,  it is a tactical delay,  all you have to do is spend five minutes greeting the iyaarans and another hour or so making small talk at the reception im the one who has to spend the next three days escorting them around the ship,  i do not enjoy these diplomatic situations,  its all part of being in starfleet there,  and i do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous uniforms,  protocol,  they look like dresses,  worf that is a remarkably outmoded and sexist attitude im surprised at you,  besides you look great in a dress,  ambassador loquel ambassador byleth im captain picard welcome aboard the enterprise,  it is our pleasure to be here captain,  we are honored to be the site of the first cultural exchange between the iyaaran people and the federation,  yes yes the next seven days should prove most illuminating,  allow me to introduce voval he will be taking you back to our homeworld,  pleased to meet you,  im looking forward to meeting with the premier of iyar,  there will be a reception in your honor where youll meet the rest of the senior staff ill be on my way to your home world of course  but im leaving you in the hands of my most experienced officers,  lieutenant worf of the klingon empire is our head of security he will be responsible for your safety while youre on board,  counselor deanna troi from the planet betazed will be your personal liaison ambassador loquel,  ambassador loquel its an honor to meet you may i show you to your quarters before we attend the reception,  please,  and my first officer commander william riker from the planet earth will be assigned to you ambassador byleth,  i want this one,  commander riker is a skilled diplomat with wide experience in interspecies contact ,  im sure im sure but i have decided i want this lieutenant worf,  well that will be  just fine mister worf ,  yes ambassador i would be pleased to ,  yes yes enough of that show me to my quarters,  so first thing tomorrow i thought id take you on a tour show you the operational centers and the residential decks of the ship then after that we could spend some time discussing some of the cultural underpinnings of your society ,  are you going to eat,  excuse me,  you have no food on your plate are you going to eat,  oh actually i was waiting until we got to the dessert tray,  dessert  what is that,  its something we eat after the main course its usually very sweet usually very bad for you we eat it purely for pleasure if you ask me its the best part of any meal,  my people eat only for nourishment,  let me introduce you to some of my favorites here we have peach cobbler with whipped cream tarvokian powder cake but over here  this is my very favorite,  this is a ktarian chocolate puff im not exactly sure whats in it but i think there are at least seventeen varieties of chocolate inside,  it is it is,  delicious,  delicious ,  ambassador i think were going to get along very well,  shall we,  this is unacceptable,  i am sorry if you do not care for our ,  bring me new food i require a higher protein and enzymatic content,  our custom in a situation like this is to serve ourselves its called a buffet and usually people prefer to choose ,  ambassador,  it is all right doctor i am happy to bring more food,  how is your diplomatic assignment progressing so far,  fine,  i have found that in moments of diplomatic tension it is often helpful to find elements of commonality,  ambassador byleth is demanding temperamental rude,  you share all of those qualities in abundance perhaps you should build on your similarities,  so i understand your homeworld has some of the most spectacular crystal formations in the sector,  is there any place in particular that you recommend i visit while im there,  no,  yes well whats our eta,  seventeen hours thirtytwo minutes,  i think ill go update my itinerary,  what happened,  there has been a system wide power failure,  whats the cause,  we have entered an energy disruption field i do not recognize the configuration,  attitude controls failing,  theres an mclass planet in this system can we reach it,  i will try,  inertial dampeners are offline life support is failing,  entering the planets atmosphere prepare for impact,  voval,  you may have a concussion try not to move,  picard to enterprise picard to enterprise do you read me,  i cant get through too much interference,  theres a structure and some energy readings about two kilometers south of here,  im going to try to find help do you understand,  try to stay conscious and dont leave the shuttle theres some sort of plasma energy on the surface ill be back as soon as i can,  youre late,  late it is ohfive hundred hours,  i told you last night i wanted to meet at this time we are supposed to tour the arboretum and biolabs,  i do not recall you saying anything about ,  are you calling me a liar,  no i simply do not remember the conversation,  i will have to add this to your list of inadequacies now dont just stand there get dressed and meet me in the arboretum,  this deck is devoted mainly to stellar cartography biological research and astrophysics,  we have over a thousand people on board engaged in all facets of the ships ,  are you sure you dont want some of this this papalla juice,  no thank you im still recovering from all those desserts last night,  are you sure it is very delicious,  im sure,  please you have been so kind please,  yum,  next were going to go to deck eight which is interesting because its not really finished its sort of a multipurpose deck,  sometimes when we need an extra lab another cabin we ,  ambassador,  what is this,  thats a child,  child,  children are our offspring our young they grow into adults over a period of many years they grow into beings like us,  offspring,  ambassador im curious how does your species procreate,  postcellular compounding we emerge from the natal pod fully grown,  i see,  do you have a name,  eric,  eric do you like dessert,  may i give eric some dessert,  that sounds like a wonderful idea,  is someone there whos there ,  what do you want who are you,  shhh,  who are you,  wait someone else was with me the pilot of the shuttlecraft hes wounded please he needs your help,  hes dead,  hello,  this smells good thank you,  this is a terellian cargo freighter isnt it is this your ship were you one of the crew,  no i was a passenger we crashed,  how many people survived are you the only one,  well youre certainly not a terellian unless youve lost two of your arms,  whats your name im jeanluc picard im a starfleet officer,  anna,  anna anna is there anyone else on this planet,  how long have you been here,  i dont know you cant see the sun here ive lost track of time,  do you remember the date your ship crashed,  stardate ,  thats seven years ago,  years,  anna its all right,  seven years i thought one year or two maybe but how could it be seven,  anna listen to me,  on my shuttle theres a lot of equipment that survived the crash we can use it to contact starfleet theyll send a ship for us we can leave,  leave,  yes both of us if you can get me back to the shuttle,  dont move its bad,  dont worry i wont move,  you have three broken ribs,  the restriction device will hold the bones in place let them,  let them knit let the bones knit,  its been a long time since i talked to anyone,  i used to talk to myself but then i thought it might mean that i was crazy so i stopped talking,  it will be a while before you can walk,  anna maybe you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment back here,  i can do that,  good go into the cockpit and look for a small com panel in the center of the instrument bay see if you can remove it and bring it to me,  stay in bed ill be back,  what is it,  i just wanted to make sure you were real,  the engineering sections encompass twelve decks of the secondary hull deck fortytwo contains the antimatter storage facility deck thirtysix houses the ,  what is the mass flow rate of the antimatter replenishment stream to the containment pods,  excuse me,  the antimatter replenishment rate what is it,  i am not certain of the exact rate,  perhaps there is someone here who does know the answer,  you are you smarter than this one,  ah well why do you ask,  never mind,  i wish to see the bussard collectors take me to them,  this way,  do you bathe,  i am going to kill him with my bare hands i will take his neck and ,  worf,  i have failed in my mission commander i am clearly a bad diplomat for the sake of the ship and the federation i request reassignment,  denied,  but commander these iyaarans are irritating arrogant they cannot be reasoned with,  ambassador loquel is quite pleasant,  i will admit hes a little unusual,  what have you learned about him so far,  he seems preoccupied with recreation in the past two days ive spent more time in ten forward and the holodeck than i have in the past two months and hes obsessed with food especially chocolate,  you must be in heaven,  to be honest hes even testing my limits,  you see they are insane,  worf youve been patient with ambassador byleth and thats good but maybe its time to let him know that some behavior is unacceptable to us i think its all right to suggest limits for the ambassador,  maybe we need to loosen things up a little bit meet in a less official capacity,  like what,  well how about a friendly game of poker,  what what are you doing get back in bed,  anna why is the door kept bolted from the outside,  for your protection,  from what,  there are dangerous animals here i got the com panel its right here,  it wasnt easy i had to force open the equipment bay to get it,  if i can boost the output field i might be able to send out a distress signal,  theres something wrong with it,  whats the matter,  the entire transmitter modules been destroyed,  how did this happen it looks as though its been hit by a phaser blast,  i had to use a phaser to cut it free maybe i accidentally damaged it you can fix it cant you,  no,  im sorry im sorry,  im sorry,  we will get out of here anna but its not going to be easy we need to work together,  i cant believe i did that ruined our one chance after waiting so long,  theres a precipice near here i used to go there and stare down into the gorge and think i could just step off and it would all be over then i realized it was the hope that was driving me crazy i had to accept that i was never going to get out of here,  anna no matter how long it takes we will get out of here,  from the moment i saw you i knew you were here to save me ill do anything you want just dont leave me i dont want to be alone again,  i love you,  i found some coltayin roots theyre not much to look at but they taste good,  what are you doing,  trying to dislodge this power cell,  youre going to hurt yourself up there let me,  ive almost got it there,  its energy relays are corroded but it might be able to hold one more charge if i can regenerate the cell we may be able to reactivate the shuttlecrafts engines,  well id say this is cause for celebration,  you know i may still have some terellian spices around here i could boil these roots and make a nice broth for us,  sounds delightful,  jeanluc if we ever do get out of here will you promise to show me this starship of yours this enterprise,  of course,  if youll hand me my tricorder i think i can repair these energy relays,  i meant what i said before i do love you,  anna i care for you a great deal i am grateful that you saved my life you are a warm and compassionate person i have a great deal of sympathy for what youve gone through alone here on this planet but i dont think youre really in love with me,  how can you say that of course i love you,  im the first person youve seen in seven years and ive brought you the hope of leaving this place isnt it possible that your feelings are a little confused right now,  no i know how i feel and i love you,  look sometimes when a person has gone through a traumatic experience like yours they come to look upon the person who rescues them as a sort of larger than life figure sometimes they become infatuated with their rescuer they may even think that theyre in love with that person,  so youre not attracted to me,  thats not true youre a very lovely woman i just think this is a little premature we dont know anything about each other,  i understand and im sorry if i made you uncomfortable,  its all right,  itll take a couple of hours for the power cell to charge after that well have to take it to the shuttle immediately the cell casing is already breaking down,  were going to get out of here anna,  ill bet ten,  ambassador the bet goes to you,  i will see the bet and i will raise ten,  thats twenty to me,  im in and i raise twenty,  excuse me ambassador those are my chips,  you are in error those chips are mine,  i saw you take two chips from my pile,  you dare to accuse me of stealing,  yes,  you are lying because you are losing the game,  perhaps i am losing because youve been cheating all along,  wait a minute lets just calm down,  even if i were cheating how would a plodding animal like you know it,  you are an insulting pompous fool if you were not an ambassador i would disembowel you right here,  do not let my title inhibit you klingon,  lieutenant worf  stop thats an order,  yes good,  wonderful very good,  thank you lieutenant worf i think i understand now that was a very effective demonstration,  what,  if you will excuse me i would like to document this experience,  the power cells ready we need to get to the shuttle,  we cant go right now,  why not,  the plasma storms are too strong its dangerous wait a few hours then well go,  we dont have a few hours i told you the cells already degrading,  jeanluc its a difficult journey the restriction field will make it hard for you to walk,  im feeling much better now and i dont intend to use this any longer,  no you cant remove it yet ,  anna,  theres no pain it would seem that my ribs werent broken after all,  jeanluc,  what the hells going on why are you trying to keep me here,  please i love you,  why do you keep me locked inside this freighter you say there are dangerous animals but ive yet to see or hear a single one of them,  and what about that com panel you said you damaged it while cutting it out of the shuttle did you i find it hard to believe you would be that clumsy with the one piece of equipment that could save you after seven years,  and what was this really for to keep me immobilized,  please i was so afraid i didnt want you to leave me,  so you found it necessary to hold me captive,  i was scared i wanted you to stay to love me,  im going to go find that shuttle myself,  no,  anna,  dont fight me,  anna no,  you should love me now were together we depend on each other i know more about you love me,  stop it,  i failed you dont love me its over,  anna wait where are you going,  anna,  hello is anyone in there,  hello,  over here theres a door on the opposite side,  over here the doors over here,  i thought you were dead,  dead,  yes theres a woman who lives here she went to the shuttle she told me you were dead,  yes that is understandable when my species is injured our metabolic rate slows until our body can heal itself this state could easily be mistaken for death,  i see,  when you did not return to the shuttle i attempted to track you the surface conditions made it very difficult so cold,  i saw someone running away from here was it the woman,  yes,  why would she leave this shelter,  she was upset,  do you think she might harm herself theres a dangerous precipice near here she was headed in that direction,  its possible,  then we should go find her,  all right you stay here  warm yourself ill go look for her,  we will go together,  captain  this ridge extends for a kilometer in either direction i suggest we separate  we can search it twice as fast,  get away from me,  you dont have to do this i found voval the shuttle pilot  hes still alive he can help us get away,  i dont care,  ill jump unless you promise to love me,  anna ,  no no i wont promise that youve been manipulating me havent you,  jeanluc what are you saying,  your necklace i broke it it was lying in the cargo freighter by the fire i left it there now its whole again and back on your neck how,  tell me about your love i must know,  wheres voval isnt it convenient that he arrived at the freighter only moments after you left and then he insisted that i come looking for you he took me here to the ledge where i found you on the cliff about to jump very welltimed wouldnt you say,  are you working together vovals the only one who couldve gotten the necklace and given it to you,  tell me about your love  or i will jump,  go ahead,  what are you waiting for its a long fall at least two hundred meters you should die instantly if thats what you really want,  but somehow i dont think it is,  i have failed,  failed voval what was the purpose of all this,  my name is ambassador voval,  ambassador,  my mission was to study human intimacy specifically the concept you call love,  you staged the crash faked my injury and arranged all this to see if i would fall in love with you,  in our study of your culture we did not understand certain concepts so we sent three representatives to study them to experience them,  what gave you the idea that trapping me here would give you the opportunity to explore love,  several years ago we discovered the remains of the terellian freighter on this planet the ship contained logs made by a single survivor  a human woman that was our first contact with human culture the woman lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed on this planet a human male,  and that man was injured the woman nursed him back to health they fell in love,  in the logs she described many concepts we found difficult to understand pleasure antagonism love these were alien to us we wished to experience them ourselves ambassador loquel was sent to experience pleasure byleth was sent to experience antagonism and i was sent to experience love was this wrong,  well lets just say that were not used to such a direct approach ambassador voval i must tell you that in our culture what youve done would be considered dangerously close to a crime,  crime ,  we can talk about that later,  the first order of business would seem to be getting off this planet am i to assume the shuttle is not as badly damaged as it looked,  that is correct i only simulated the crash we can leave at any time,  then lets go,  you seem a little sore,  lieutenant worf was kind enough to engage me in eleven hours of holodeck battle exercises,  eleven hours,  i learned a great deal about the concept of antagonism,  it was excruciating,  counselor these are bioenzymatic supplements that my people consume for food im afraid you will find they are not as delicious as your chocolate,  after the past few days i could use something a little bland,  thank you captain this has been an enlightening experience,  for me as well ambassador,  and i am sorry if our diplomatic methods offended you,  on the contrary i found your approach intriguing we humans tend to take a rather balanced approach to life never too much never too little its nice to find a culture thats willing to take an experience to its furthest extremes,  goodbye captain",7

fact i,  well think no further dear heart shes here,  yes indeed,  serious always so serious,  well at the moment lwaxana i am rather busy,  and youre always busy with something or other never the right thing though my daughter says were picking up someone interesting here,  yes the leading scientist of kaelon two and,  kaelon two never heard of it,  this is a delicate situation lwaxana our first real contact with a very reclusive people and as it will be something of an official greeting,  ah diplomacy i adore diplomacy everyone dresses so well,  energize please mister obrien,  doctor timicin i am jeanluc picard captain of the enterprise this is lieutenant commander la forge,  we welcome you aboard sir,  i beg your pardon captain this is my first time aboard a federation starship,  oh yes they told me shaking of hands a greeting,  ah i beg your pardon doctor timicin may i present lwaxana troi of betazed also a guest on board and,  house holder of the sacred chalice of rixx heir to the holy rings of betazed and what are you doing for dinner,  well i we have quite a bit of work planned,  the mans never been on a starship before jeanluc somebody certainly ought to make him comfortable before you get started,  it uh would seem mrs troi is our acting ambassador of good will today,  just think of me as your entertainment director,  that man is in a lot of trouble,  captains log stardate  for generations the people of kaelon two have been working to revitalize their dying sun the federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a solution to this problem,  the basic theories for helium fusion enhancement have been discussed for over a century but theres been no method of practical application until now,  the modifications that you have made on the torpedos guidance systems are remarkable doctor,  well see they still have to be proven in a practical test,  at least now it is possible i never dared hope to find such a perfect match with our own sun,  our only regret is that it took us three years to find a suitable star after you first contacted us,  this means a great deal to us to me we are not used to dealing with other worlds to asking for anything from others but your offer to help it has given us a possible means to our survival,  its your work thats made this possible doctor,  thats right were only the delivery service here,  it has taken forty years of my life to develop the programming which will control your photon torpedos it has been my life my only wish has been to find a way to revive our sun before i die thank you for giving me this opportunity,  mrs troi i must protest your unauthorized presence on the bridge,  what does this little one do mister woof,  please madame that is a torpedo launch initiator and it uh it is worf madame not woof,  oh,  ah there you are dear ive been waiting for you,  and so nice to see you again so soon,  mrs troi,  yes mother what did you want,  what,  you were waiting for me,  of course i was dear you really must let me do something to relieve the tedium of all this work work work,  as a matter of fact we really havent,  mother,  yes dear you go play now motherll be fine,  mother,  im afraid im expected in engineering im really terribly sorry,  mrs troi ill have to ask you to clear the bridge now please,  i dont see why there are lots of other people here,  mother please,  dont you worry well just have to chat a bit later,  id never have thought her old enough to be your mother shes so vibrant,  is that why you reset the torpedo sustainer engines to run on less reactants,  exactly once we were able to protect the triggering mechanism the flight engine power levels could be minimized another simulation youll see that the temperature should stabilize at twotwenty,  enough is enough rescue is at hand doctor timicin will you clear all that mess from the table please,  that mess mrs troi,  now now now youve been shut up in here for hours perfectly ridiculous the table please,  if you boys dont eat something youre going to be sick and whos that going to help ive made some irresistible mantickian pate mister homn will lay it out for us,  mister homn is my valet he doesnt say much,  how can he,  it is true that the intellectual efficiency of high order beings does diminish proportionately when the deprivation of rest or nutritious fuel is,  all right all right dont you start,  mrs troi,  you are a wise woman im sure we could use a respite,  these two call me mrs troi you call me lwaxana mister homn spread it,  so knowing that my daughters starship would be passing fairly close to betazed i maneuvered a ride and here i am deck eight,  i also have a grown daughter she has a little boy of her own,  then youre married,  my wife died quite some time ago,  one thing i dont understand if your people have known for generations that their sun is dying why not simply evacuate the planet,  it is our home it defines who we are as a people if kaelon ceases to exist so do we,  then you definitely should fix it,  with the federations help i hope we will,  and the federation is pleased to offer whatever help it can which means you will come in for a nightcap,  thats extremely kind of you but,  my valet sleeps elsewhere,  you are delightful you make me laugh i mean i dont mean your invitation makes me laugh i mean i take it quite seriously but,  then say yes and ill make you laugh some more,  i wish i could but i have to say no,  goodnight lwaxana,  captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at the praxillus system where we will conduct doctor timicins helium ignition test,  mother how much,  little one why do you refuse to use telepathy even when we are alone,  we are not alone mother now how much longer will this take youve been selecting for twenty minutes,  i am a woman dressing for a man something you might try now and then dear i wonder if timicin likes green,  thats not very telepathic of you,  i tried telepathy on him hes the wrong species right species for everything else though and you might try that once in a while too,  you know youre not just incorrigible youre insatiable,  captain i have completed long range scans no life forms are present in the system,  spacecraft,  no others within sensor range,  picard to engineering,  final prelaunch diagnostic level five,  all systems verified,  were ready when you are captain,  very well mister worf,  photon torpedoes armed and targeted,  fire in sequence,  first volley released,  tracking torpedoes entry program confirmed,  second volley released third volley,  torpedoes now entering the stellar core,  their shields are holding guidance systems normal,  ignition sequence six seconds three seconds now,  shock wave patterns within predicted range seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma radiation levels helium fusion rate increasing,  what about the heat and pressure levels,  steady so far density at eleven hundred grams per cubic centimeter temperature approaching sixty million degrees kelvin,  we want it to stabilize at two hundred and twenty million,  pressure wave harmonics dispersing temperature in target zone increasing to eightyone million degrees,  still rising ninety million degrees kelvin and now one hundred ten million looking good,  one hundred thirtyseven,  radiation and pressure levels still stable,  temperature one hundred sixty million degrees kelvin,  one seventy one ninety now two hundred million,  its happening,  twoohseven and rising twonineteen and twenty two twenty and holding,  looks like congratulations may be in order,  mister data,  turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters,  twotwentytwo,  temperature is rising in the core again captain two hundred and thirty million degrees kelvin,  rising two hundred sixty million degrees,  rate exceeding critical levels core density becoming unstable,  lets get the hell out of here,  warp two ensign now,  im sorry,  captain picard permit me,  most grateful,  ensign set a course for kaelon two warp factor five,  i had one of those named after me once by a brilliant young astronomer from rigel four of course i sparkled a bit myself in those days thats called fishing for a compliment youre supposed to tell me that i still sparkle im sorry im not helping am i,  youre very kind im just not adequate company right now,  thats all right i can make enough conversation for both of us,  ill leave you alone,  no please stay i wanted to tell you how much i wish that that we had met years ago,  what difference do a few years make,  unfortunately a great deal the fact is lwaxana im going home now to die,  captains log stardate  we are orbiting kaelon two and have established contact with science minister btardat,  the experiment did achieve a stable core temperature for a short time minister that is a significant step forward,  were studying the sensor logs and torpedo telemetry to see if there was any malfunction if we can discover the problem another test might be successful,  but wouldnt that require a lengthy search to find a suitable star for a second test,  the federation is willing to assist in the search,  in the meantime all of our facilities would be available to doctor timicin while he analyzes the experiment,  a most thoughtful and generous offer but timicin has obligations at home and it will take some time to select his replacement,  were more than willing to extend our visit sir,  that will not be necessary well contact you when were ready we expect timicin to return home as soon as possible again gentlemen thank you,  come,  jeanluc are you aware that these people youre so graciously helping are murderers,  i beg your pardon,  well the next thing to it when a person on this benighted little world reaches the age of sixty which timicin is about to do theyre expected to simply kill themselves did you know that,  the people of kaelon two are isolationists almost to the point of being xenophobes regrettably we know very little about their customs,  well i know  timicin himself just told me hes supposed to go down there to his loving friends be wined dined honored for his achievements and then kill himself its a barbaric ritual the resolution its called obviously you cant let him go jeanluc,  im afraid i have no choice,  i dont think youve been listening to me the man is supposed to kill himself you dont just let that happen you dont just turn your back whats the matter with you,  lwaxana im sorry but i have no jurisdiction here irrespective of any personal feelings we simply cannot interfere ,  but you have to in a situation like this you absolutely have to interfere go down there and talk to those people jeanluc do all the things you do so well open their eyes educate them,  the prime directive forbids us to interfere with the social order of any planet,  its your prime directive  not mine,  computer locate counselor troi,  what dyou mean i cant go down there are you telling me im a prisoner on this ship,  mother whats going on what are you doing,  im sorry counselor but im not sure what to do here,  well im sure i am a betazoid ambassador the daughter of the fifth house and those people are going to answer to me so you just energize this damned thing and get me down there,  he cant mother he has his orders,  his orders dont apply to me,  no they apply to him,  dont try your professional patronizing on me young lady they expect timicin to die dont you realize that he expects to die because hes sixty what is sixty its nothing,  ill uh go check the pattern buffers,  come on mother lets sit down,  im sorry little one i dont know whats wrong with me im sorry,  theres no need to be,  but im crying i dont cry,  you cried when father died,  you remember that,  of course i remember we both cried,  but this isnt the same is it,  what do you think mother,  i dont know i just cant accept that fate would allow me to meet him like this and then take him away hes not ill he hasnt had a tragic accident hes just going to die for no good reason except his society has decided hes too old so they dispose of him as though his life no longer has value or meaning,  you cant possibly understand at your age but at mine sometimes you feel tired and afraid,  you afraid i never could tell,  you werent supposed to life really does pass deanna the fun of it the joy the being attractive,  youre feeling very vulnerable very know you so well mother and believe me you will never be one of those who dies before they die,  come in,  ive been studying the preliminary reports from the test i dont understand where i went wrong i thought id anticipated all of the variables deep convection patterns the proton reactions neutrino count,  ill say it again youre a kind woman,  im a hateful woman i hate what youre going to do and i hate you for doing it,  its the way of my world i wish you could accept that,  i never will never,  how long have you been sitting there,  im not sure a minute an hour,  lwaxana,  do you want anything some tea ,  lwaxana i want to explain i want very much for you to understand,  until fifteen or twenty centuries ago we had no resolution no such concern for our elders as people aged their health failed they became invalids those who could no longer be cared for by their families were put away in deathwatch facilities where they simply waited in loneliness for the end to come often for years they had meant something and then they were forced to live past that through a terrible time of meaning nothing of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger peoples patience we are no longer that cruel lwaxana,  no youre not cruel to them you just kill them,  the resolution is a celebration of life we can end our lives with dignity,  celebration of life it all sounds very noble very caring what youre really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of the people,  i know it must sound that way it is a time of transition one generation handing the responsibilities of life to the next,  what about the responsibility of taking care of the elderly,  but that would create a dreadful burden for our children,  we raise them and care for them suffer for them and keep them from harm their whole lives eventually its their turn to take care of us,  no parent should expect to be paid back for the love theyve given their children,  why the hell not,  oskoids,  whats that,  oskoids a betazed delicacy,  looks interesting,  you should have tried it while you were still alive no reason to bother now,  why sixty why not sixtytwo or fiftyeight,  a reasonable age had to be set,  certainly not in your case right now youre as healthy and vital a man as ive ever known,  my family and colleagues while im still that way in complete command of my faculties knowing theyll always remember me as a strong vigorous man,  but it makes no sense some of your people could still be active at seventy or eighty others might get seriously ill at fifty how cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide,  setting a standard age for the resolution makes it uniform for everybody to ask each individual family to decide when their elders are to die would be heartless,  i agree how about letting everybody die when they die,  you have a grandson you said,  almost seven,  wouldnt it be better for him to know his grandfather not the vague memory of someone who once loved him but a living person who does love him you really dont believe thats better,  lwaxana i attended the resolution of my own parents when it was their time it was beautiful its a custom ive known and accepted all my life,  the women of betazed used to wear huge wigs with large holes in the middle for tiny caged animals first it was a fashion then it went on long enough to become a custom a tradition but it was uncomfortable for the woman and cruel to the animal then one day one very formidable woman finally said so and refused to wear another of those wigs and fairly soon the custom stopped she had the courage to stand up and fight for change,  she must have been a lot like you,  timicin there is no one more qualified more experienced or more likely to save your planet than you and they would have you kill yourself,  younger scientists will take my place the work will continue,  your planet has what thirty forty years left what if they cant find the answer without your help what then what chance will your grandson have of reaching the age of sixty,  enough please it is my time lwaxana that is the way it is,  if thats the way it is why is anyone bothering to try to save your world at all if its time has come let it die wheres the difference timicin where,  destabilized all the results were exactly as you had predicted,  the triggering programs ,  worked perfectly that much were sure of,  and we had always assumed that was our greatest hurdle,  just getting this far is a big step doctor no ones ever been able to do even this much before,  convection boundary uncoupling the reaction caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude why,  there was a evidence of a delayed surface shock,  no i anticipated that i thought id anticipated all the possible variables but stars theyre like living entities in a way quite unpredictable i wouldnt be surprised if this were the result of,  look here fortytwo seconds into the test a rise in the level of hydrogenalpha emissions and here another one you see im right,  there had to be neutron migration within the stars inner core as the reaction grew,  perhaps but there is no known method of controlling neutron migration doctor,  yes yes but it is theoretically possible using these test results we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamics of the star that can test a new detonation program im certain it can be accomplished certain its just a matter of time a matter of time,  come,  timicin time for you to leave us then,  captain picard ive come to officially request asylum aboard the enterprise,  timicin i cannot believe this why asylum asylum from what,  i turn sixty in four days minister,  yes and your family and colleagues are already gathering for your resolution,  i,  i believe it is time for us as a people to reexamine the wisdom of the resolution,  timicin are they forcing you into this are you being coerced,  influenced perhaps not coerced,  captain picard your influence is an example of why we originally chose isolation and no doubt will again,  any influence minister is by example only timicins decision is of his own free will i assure you,  i cannot believe that a man of timicins stature would freely reject his own culture,  btardat no one on kaelon two understands the project as i do there are new theories that would take others a decade to test and confirm with my guidance we can be ready in half that time i must finish my work,  others started your work others will finish it its always been that way it always will,  captain scanners indicate two kaelon warships rising on an intercept course,  acknowledged commander minister we are here in friendship hoping to provide assistance,  youve helped quite enough captain i suggest you return timicin and depart if you attempt to leave orbit with him on board our ships have been ordered to open fire,  btardat theres no purpose in,  it should not have come to this i handled it poorly,  doctor you have acted in good conscience i dont know what else you could have done,  i could have let well enough alone and returned home what do you think picard have i done the right thing,  im afraid youre the only one who can answer that doctor,  lwaxana would have me lead a revolt but i am only a scientist i wish i had her strength she is a woman of extraordinary conviction isnt she,  isnt she,  any communication number one,  no sir we have an open channel,  the warships have taken a standard attack posture staggered approach vectors within weapons range,  shields up red alert,  captain,  doctor i suggest you return to your quarters,  no i dont want there to be any bloodshed because of my decision,  theyll be doing everything they can to avoid it but we need to get out of their way now,  mister worf ascertain their offensive potential,  aye sir,  yes yes i understand,  we must transmit the new analysis of the neutron migration immediately if i can make them see the direction ive taken,  weve already tried,  they refuse to accept further reports from you doctor,  but they have to accept them,  if i can reestablish computer interface with the science ministry,  theyve disengaged the linkup sir,  why dont they answer,  even if i find the solution they would not accept it because i do not terminate my life they terminate my work alive i am a greater threat to my world than a dying sun,  jeanluc will find a way to settle this he always does,  no my decision will only lead to more distrust of other worlds nothing will change,  dont be foolish,  i am not being foolish,  lwaxana i want to live because i see in you how much there is to live for you make me realize there is still some value to my life i can still contribute i can be an example to my people but discovering these new desires in myself and not being able to do anything with them not being able to finish my work not being able to reach my people,  you have made a statement about the sanctity of life it will be heard timicin,  who will hear it from lightyears away where do i go now lwaxana a man without a world who can never go home,  timicin,  bridge to doctor timicin,  btardat,  no doctor its your daughter,  father,  dara,  you look wonderful,  this is lwaxana troi shes been a host and a friend,  ive been looking forward to meeting you dara,  whatever you have to say to me you can say in front of her,  i see,  father come home this is wrong,  dara there is so much for me still to do if i could show you the work i have begun,  theres nothing for me to look at it is irrelevant,  your fathers work may save your world my dear i would hardly consider that irrelevant,  all that matters to me now is you not your work your works over it is your time to rest,  perhaps you will feel differently as you get a little older say approaching sixty,  my father has taught me to cherish the resolution i dont know how you have poisoned him to reject it but,  it is an obscene ritual,  how dare you how dare you criticize my way of life my beliefs,  please,  where will you go,  i dont know,  where will you die,  i cannot bear the thought that you will be laid to rest on some other world,  my mother and i will not be able to lie beside you when my resolution comes,  im sorry father i do not understand how you can go on with your life knowing each day you live is an insult to everything we believe in i love you but i am ashamed,  i need to be alone now,  i am suddenly suddenly not sure of myself and it is a feeling i am not at all used to i dont think i like it very much little one,  not sure of yourself,  my life has been full now and then its even overflowed a little ill admit but i enjoyliving now i am asking myself  is it possible that ive been wrong to encourage timicin to choose life,  you were honest with him mother how could you be anything else,  maybe i want him to live just to keep me company,  of course you do but you didnt do this for yourself mother you did it for him,  did i then look what ive done to him he is like a man who has lost his faith i never considered how deeply ingrained this resolution liturgy is,  ritual provides a structure for a society good rituals bad rituals alike,  well this is a bad one,  your point of view,  it should be the point of view of any reasonably intelligent middleaged person but apparently it is not,  ill see you later mother,  youre going back,  do you believe i love you,  i do you know but if that finally is my only reason to stay alive,  its not enough,  almost not quite i cant be that selfish lwaxana,  youd never be happy,  im sorry i guess im not the one to lead the revolt,  i apologize for all the turmoil i created captain,  i would deeply regret it doctor if you were returning only to ease diplomatic tensions,  no it is more much more,  then i wish you and your people well,  when the time comes for another test i will encourage them to seek out your assistance again,  if theres any reason youd like to wait a few minutes,  no weve weve said our goodbyes,  lwaxana ,  it is the custom for your loved ones to join you at this resolution is it not,  you dont have to do this,  yes i do,  permission to disembark captain i promise not to cause any problems down there,  permission granted,  were ready mister obrien",7
80,night terrors,18.57,2.99,30.24,2.51,20.09,19.2,6.39,0.0,0.0,2708.0," captains log stardate  we are proceeding through the uncharted rim of a binary star system where we may have located the uss brattain the missing science vessel failed to arrive at its destination and has not been heard from since a distress call twentynine days ago,  magnify,  its the brattain all right,  the ship is intact sir with no indications of structural damage,  engines,  all propulsion systems are shut down the ship is drifting,  life form readings,  inconclusive sir,  counselor,  there is life on board but,  what is it,  i dont know something,  number one assemble your team,  doctor crusher report to transporter room three data worf,  commander i need to go also,  there is no indication of malfunction in any of the main systems,  heres another one,  this was done by a phaser at a setting of six or seven,  there are more over here,  the entire bridge crew,  whoever did this may still be on board,  theres someone alive but he didnt kill these people,  here,  hes alive,  i think he is betazoid,  its all right were going to help you,  what happened here who did this to you,  were almost finished with the autopsies captain,  how long will it take you to compile the data,  its complicated  the dead were found everywhere some locked in their rooms  barricaded with weapons piled around them some in corridors where theyd obviously had handtohand combat ill have to sort through and analyze the details,  weve identified him as andrus hagan from betazed science advisor hes in a profound catatonic state,  im not getting much captain a few words disconnected phrases i can feel his terror but i cant seem to reach him,  dont give up on him counselor were examining the brattain for clues  but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there,  im here im right here theres nothing to be afraid of anymore,  you hear voices what do they say,  keep talking to me ill try to understand,  all engines check out perfectly commander once we get them started up the brattain can get back to starbase under her own power,  lets give it a try,  preheating injectors data fuel flow,  matter valves are open and operating magnetic containment on the antimatter pods is constant,  okay open injectors,  injectors open,  there is no engine activity at all,  whats wrong geordi,  nothings wrong i dont understand it,  come,  ive been studying the autopsy reports the conclusion is appalling,  there was no outside source no alien presence the crew of the brattain all thirtyfour of them  appear to have killed each other,  what could have caused such an event drugs a virus poison,  toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their systems and they were in good health but for whatever reason they seem to have turned against each other using phasers knives  and bare hands,  id like you to see this captain its from the logs of the brattain captain zahevas mental condition deteriorated steadily after they became stranded she began talking of plots and mutinies,  this is the last entry made after they had been adrift for over three weeks,  first officer brink and his men were behind it they got to the engines dont work anymore had to eliminate brink the ship is out of out of were running out too dangerous out of brink and his men,  be sure to call me if theres any change in his condition ill be in my office,  where are you,  im coming where are you,  eyes in the dark one moon circles,  see the eyes in the dark one moon,  where are you,  captains log stardate  four days have passed but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the brattain i have decided we will return to starbase twotwenty,  forge is rigging the brattain for towing,  im going to try recalibrating the field generators i still dont see why we cant get the engines going it just doesnt make any sense,  someones still here,  theyre alive,  ensign what is it,  cant you hear it theres someone left alive on the ship,  i heard i mean i thought i heard something,  the ship was searched thoroughly theres no one left aboard,  sorry sir my mistake,  thirtyfour people were found dead on this ship that could make anyone uneasy,  thank you sir,  im here can you hear me,  tell me about the voices you hear,  bright one pole two poles,  i dont understand tell me more about the poles,  boy what a day this was im doing an isozyme study on some populations of cardilia but theyre turning out to have some really weird polymorphisms what a headache,  is that why you were late,  oh no i had a conference with doctor balthus she wants to do a study on the laticifer ontogeny of the kaladian thorn flower but i dont have the time to oversee another project,  was tom corbin there,  what,  tom corbin from the science lab remember him,  of course i remember him but ,  you use any excuse to pay him a visit,  miles what are you saying,  i think you know exactly what im saying,  if i didnt know better id say youre jealous,  you take me for a fool,  hello chief have some coffee,  ive been drinking too much coffee maybe some hot tea guinan,  coming up,  kind of a surprise to see you in here at this hour,  hows that,  youre not out of the honeymoon yet usually newlyweds cant keep their hands off each other,  she has work to do she heads up the plant biology lab you know,  any strange things going on down there,  like what,  ive been hearing things kenicki in engineering told me he saw a man in an old starfleet uniform riding the lift near the engine core but when the lift got to the top there was no one on it,  ghost stories,  theres more lots more strange things are happening on this ship obrien,  im surprised at you gillespie a starfleet officer i have more to worry about than shades and spirits,  come,  captain do you have a moment,  were concerned whatever happened on the brattain  may be starting here,  explain,  beverly and i have both gotten unusual reports people behaving strangely others hearing sounds that arent there,  are we talking about hallucinations,  in some cases in others  just erratic behavior,  we cant track down any common element that might be responsible,  but everything started when we found the brattain,  yes captain  we have to get the enterprise away from here before it gets worse,  we are preparing to take the brattain in tow well be on our way within the hour,  ensign maneuver us into position within tractor beam range,  aye sir,  is there a problem ensign,  i cant seem to remember how to enter the coordinates sir,  ready now captain,  ensign rager report to sickbay,  yes sir,  ensign lin put us into position to engage the tractor beam,  aye sir,  mister worf ready tractor beam,  ensign we are losing maneuverability did you throttle down by mistake,  no sir,  captain thrusters are losing power,  impulse engines ahead minimum power,  impulse engines are not responding sir,  riker to engineering whats going on down there,  i dont know sir nothings responding,  ensign go to warp engines  factor one engage,  captain we dont have warp drive either,  data do we have any propulsion system that is functional,  no sir apparently we do not,  were adrift,  just like the brattain,  captains log stardate 99 we have now been adrift for a total of ten days we have sent subspace distress calls but because of our distant location we cannot expect a response for at least another two weeks,  after analyzing the sensor logs from the brattain and the enterprise as well as the data from our last series of probes i have concluded that,  massive rupture in space undetectable by normal means into which energy is absorbed,  you mean a tykens rift,  a what,  a rare anomaly named for bela tyken the melthusian captain who first encountered it,  a tykens rift  of course that would explain why we dont have engine power,  the ships energy is being drained into the fissure before we can utilize it,  i was detained,  when tyken was trapped in a rift his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly fortunately his cargo included anicium and yurium which he used to detonate a massive explosion he then escaped through the ruptured center of the rift,  but we arent carrying anything that could produce that kind of explosion even our photon torpedoes wouldnt be enough,  cant we replicate the elements tyken used,  we no longer have the power to reproduce complex elements with our replicators we must find a way to generate a violent energy release without relying on conventional means,  data in tykens experience did the crew exhibit behavioral changes,  no there were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew,  what about nightmares,  there was no record of sleep distubances of any kind counselor,  then  what is it whats happening to us,  so far the only one who doesnt seem affected by all this is data bridge,  number one how are you,  sir,  any hallucinations nightmares,  no but id be a liar if i said i felt like myself i bite my tongue to keep from snapping at people and a couple of times when ive gone into my quarters someone in there waiting for me,  with everyone around us succumbing its even more important that at least one of us stay in control of his faculties i want you to turn in take a nap ill be on the bridge and you can relieve me in four hours,  all right sir deck eight,  no no,  no stop no,  sir ,  as you were,  mister data in my ready room please,  sir commander la forge and i have come up with a potential solution to our predicament perhaps the modifications we used to increase firepower against the borg might be effective here,  channeling power into the main deflector dish,  i believe within six hours we can generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the tykens rift,  very well proceed,  mister data,  sir,  apparently i am not immune to the strange forces at work on this ship,  yes sir,  its a frightening prospect to lose control of your mind when i was young i saw my grandfather deteriorate from a powerful robust figure to a  a frail wisp of a man who couldnt even remember how to make his way home,  it is my responsibility somehow to see that this ship is guided to safety i will have to rely on you from now on we may need to count on you for our very survival,  yes sir i will do my best,  i want to do more crosssections on the brain tissue of some of these bodies set up the positron emission sensors in sickbay ill decide which ones i want to study,  go away,  captain let me ask you this since we located the brattain can you remember any of your dreams,  i hardly ever remember dreams,  a lot of people dont but think have you had a dream in the last ten days,  i dont recall,  im betting you havent whats more neither has anyone else on board this ship  except troi i began to realize it when she talked about her nightmares,  ive done additional brain tissue tests on some of the bodies from the the,  the brattain,  crosssection of our crew they all show the same result a unique chemical imbalance,  caused by  ,  dream deprivation,  every night we we enter into sleep,  i believe the doctor means to say that humans enter what is known as rem sleep rapid eye movement it is the level of brainwave activity at which you dream,  we need dreams to survive if we dont get rem sleep we dont dream and we begin to lose our becomes hard to concentrate we forget how to do the most ordinary task,  then we become irritable paranoid some people experience hallucinations,  youre describing the situation on this ship but counselor troi has reported nightmares,  maybe its because shes betazoid i dont know but theres something more going on here than being stuck in a tykens rift and i dont know how or why its happening,  but i do know this there is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern if i cant find a way to reverse it  we are all going to go insane,  where are you ,  eyes in the dark one moon circles,  im still here i havent gone anywhere,  do you remember anything more,  what does that mean is something doubled,  deanna nothings working ive tried somatic drugs ive tried inducing theta waves in the entorhinal cortex no matter what i do no one can reach rem sleep no one can dream except you,  except me and all i have is nightmares i can barely sleep at all anymore,  in the end ill be like him just like him,  i think its some kind of experiment captain picard wants to see how well take it stuck here like rats,  you couldnt be more wrong,  its like were laboratory animals i dont want to sit and wait for death to sneak up behind me,  whats that supposed to mean,  you heard about them on the brattain shut in their rooms dying alone thats not for me id rather go out fighting,  okay all power has been channelled to the the,  i cant remember what its called,  the main deflector dish,  yes so now what do we do,  we must coordinate our effort with the bridge,  data to bridge,  yes,  we are ready to discharge the main deflector captain,  all right,  mister worf  activate the deflector,  deflector power coils charging,  peeples,  security to engineering,  youve been changing the reactant mix thats why were stuck here,  deflector powerbanks approaching maximum discharge in fifteen seconds,  confine ensign peeples to sickbay,  ill tell everyone what youre doing commander,  data this detonation better work we arent gonna last much longer,  discharge in three seconds two one,  nothing it just fizzled out,  the energy output was absorbed into the rift,  data can we try again,  no sir if we draw more power we risk losing lifesupport systems,  lujpu jihe alexandrijn,  worf no,  you will not stop me,  security to lieutenant worfs quarters immediately,  no one will stop me,  why worf what is it,  i am no longer a warrior i am no longer strong i feel,  what is it you feel,  i feel fear,  worf to admit that you are afraid gives you strength,  something is waiting for us i am not strong enough to fight it,  no worf it is just an illusion it is not real please put down the knife,  its all right everything is fine thank you,  let me take you to sickbay,  acting captains log stardate of the enterprise at the request of captain picard our situation is deteriorating many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter,  once before you said double what did you mean what is double,  twin cannot leave the twin one moon circling,  no no please cant,  you want to leave why cant you,  cant go help one moon circling eyes thats it eyes in the dark cant leave,  eyes in the dark thats what the voice said in my dream,  is that where you heard it in a dream over and over ,  beverly i know what it is i know whats happening,  what ,  my nightmare its not a dream its not a dream at all its a message,  rem sleep occurs at a different frequency for betazoids than other humanoids i believe these beings are using that frequency to communicate telepathically,  it is conceivable that this telepathic communication is creating an interference that prevents rem sleep in other species  that would be an explanation for why the rest of the crew is not dreaming,  counselor what are these  beings  trying to tell us,  theyre calling for help i think theyre trapped just like we are eyes in the dark could mean this twin star system,  your hypothesis is certainly plausible,  it may well be that there is another ship on the other side of the fissure where we cannot detect it,  is there any way to block their signals,  we have no technology to block telepathic transmissions doctor,  maybe communication through dreams can work both ways i could try to get them to stop,  perhaps we can accomplish more than that if we could coordinate our efforts with these beings we might work together to free ourselves,  it is conceivable in working with patients who have debilitating nightmares i have often used a therapetuic treament known as directed dreaming,  dreamers can learn to take control of their dreams retain a conscious memory even while theyre in rem sleep i should be able to remember a short message,  if its possible what would you say ,  what we must discover is a means by which working together with the aliens we can produce an explosion more intense than either of us could achieve alone,  what is it youre looking for,  these are the elements we have available some of them could be used in the creation of an explosive reaction if we can communicate this inventory to the other ship perhaps they will be able to ,  no data thats too complex this has to be a simple clear message,  i am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate,  stop go back,  further back there stop,  one moon circles ,  yes counselor one electron circles one proton this is a hydrogen atom,  one moon circles thats what they have been telling me over and over,  perhaps the aliens are thinking as we are to collaborate in producing an explosion if hydrogen is combined with certain elements calendenium for example it is extremely volatile but would the message mean they have hydrogen or want hydrogen,  if it is a distress call theyd be asking for what they need not what they already have,  then a proper course of action would be for us to release hydrogen into the rift and hope that they have a substance which could detonate it,  how do i tell them what to do,  if you are correct counselor i believe they have already told us what to do and are waiting for us to do it when we are ready the only message you should try to convey is now,  i can help keep you in rem sleep for a while with this cortical scanner it will maintain electrical activity in your brain at the proper frequencies,  counselor you will have to communicate with the other ship within two minutes of entering rem sleep,  two minutes is that all data,  unfortunately yes we have only enough power to emit a hydrogen stream for that period of time they must understand that they have to detonate it immediately sir we are ready to implement the plan,  proceed,  we will need to draw power from the life support systems in order to discharge the collectors this is acting captain data all personnel will report to designated shelter areas immediately,  continue only in emergency shelter areas,  hear that  get us jammed into shelter areas we sit and wait to die nobodyll ever find us,  you can all relax ten forward is a designated shelter area,  do we want to die here like helpless children,  security to tenforward right away,  we dont even know what were dying for,  gillespie sit down youre not helping matters any,  whats wrong with standing up for ourselves,  i say captain owes us some answers lets go,  hold it,  whats that ,  its a little souvenir i picked up on magus three,  stand aside guinan im not feeling so good and i dont have much patience,  im not feeling so good myself in fact im real irritable so i hope nobodys got the idea theyre going through this door because theyll have to go through me first,  pgo signals steady visual cortex is showing increased activity rapid eye movements commencing,  crusher to bridge shes in rem sleep,  thank you doctor activating the bussard collectors,  eyes in the dark,  we have ninety seconds remaining,  how is she doctor,  still in rem sleep,  and how are you,  where are you i have to find you i have to tell you,  fortyfive seconds remaining,  please i must find you tell you,  thirty seconds,  ten seconds,  nothing no explosion,  the counselor was unsuccessful,  activate impulse engines,  engines activated sir,  we have cleared the rift sir warp engines are coming back on line,  set a course,  setting a course for starbase twotwenty sir as my final duty as acting captain i order you to bed i shall do the same for all personnel,  very well mister data,  and thank you,  yes sir pleasant dreams",7
151,the schizoid man,28.25,10.21,40.59,5.17,10.26,0.0,5.52,0.0,0.0,3713.0," medical log stardate  ira graves is arguably the greatest human mind in the known universe,  for years hes lived in near isolation on a remote planet devoting full time to his revolutionary work,  eight hours ago we monitored a message from his assistant urgently requesting medical aid it seems graves health is failing rapidly  i only hope we can reach him in time,  any response from gravesworld mister worf,  nothing sir not since their initial communication,  they send out a plea for help then shut off the transmitters so they cant tell if helps on the way doesnt make much sense does it,  whats our eta at the planet mister crusher,  thirtysix minutes to orbit sir,  you understand the importance of doing everything we can for doctor graves,  of course captain,  starfleet command believes his work in quantum physics is reaching a critical stage they consider this a priority one action,  a man is ill captain treating him is my priority one regardless of who he is,  its wonderful what is it,  a year on the planet thurasia is four hundred and ninety days long it rains twice and only twice youre drinking thurasian rain water,  water tastes more like,  heaven,  exactly where can i get some more of this,  next rainfall in a hundred and sixty three days,  im not sure i can wait that long,  hey old friend any luck,  i believe my quest has ended in complete success,  datas been scouring the library in search of the perfect joke,  i have explored seventysix thousand two hundred and twentythree anecdotes thus far,  why data,  it is an attempt to find the most humorous anecdote in recorded history and i believe i have done just that,  this i gotta hear,  there were twelve birds sitting on a fence six had a notion to fly away how many were left,  okay ill bite six,  no twelve they only had a notion to fly away,  you did not find it wildly hilarious,  what do you think,  perhaps i should have described the interesting plumage of ,  wouldve helped that joke chilled my blood,  receiving a transmission from gravesworld sir its unfocused not directed specifically at us,  on screen mister worf,  send a doctor things are getting worse ,  try and raise her mister crusher tell them were minutes away,  its no good sir i dont believe theyre receiving us,  our records show that she and graves are the only ones living on the planet captain,  then what scared her,  sir im picking up another signal but its not from the planet,  confirmed point of origin sector threefive mark seven,  signal is very weak sir audio only,  pipe it through mister la forge,  outer hull breached environmental systems compro  need immediate,  i show the mary rogers in that general vicinity captain shes a transport ship used to ferry settlers to new colonies no other ships of any kind in this sector,  outer hull breached  their air must be leaking out,  there may be hundreds of colonists aboard that ship weve got to help them,  and what about graves,  hes one man and we dont even know the nature of his illness,  hes the man we came to assist i have my orders doctor,  suggestion sir,  suggest we execute long range transport of away team to assist dr graves at earliest possible moment we can use the mass of the planet to slingshot us toward the stricken liner thus making up most of the lost time,  mister crusher make it so  prepare for extended touch and go orbit,  aye sir,  the transport may be a bit tricky id like you to handle it mister la forge,  understood captain,  assemble an away team number one include whatever medical assistants the doctor deems necessary,  excuse me sir but id be more useful dealing with the mary rogers there may be hundreds wholl need attention ,  those decisions youre going to gravesworld,  i cannot comprehend it it is beyond my ability to reason,  dont feel too bad data humor is subjective,  but this anecdote had all the elements humans find so diverting a play on words colorful characters deception a lively setting ,  interesting how so,  birds are considered to have boring personalities they just sit around and eat seed all day maybe squawk once in a while boring,  in fact theres only one thing birds do thats funny but you couldnt put that in a joke and keep it tasteful now chickens chickens are funny,  hello guinan keeping this guy out of trouble,  its a challenge but im trying,  excuse me sir but in what way is guinan attempting to restrain me from adversity,  never mind data i was only joking,  that joke was funny was it not,  it wasnt meant to be data,  are you really going down to see ira graves the ira graves,  how did you know about that,  remember will  great men have great egos,  come on data a great man awaits,  may i ask a question sir,  i think you just did,  quite correct may i ask you another question after this one,  sure whats on your mind,  do you think it is pointless for me to try and understand humor,  pointless not necessarily,  i believe that comprehending what is truly funny will bring me closer to humanness until recently i thought i was making progress,  for example commander do you find this amusing there were twelve aquatic fowl sitting on a fence and six had ,  how did you ,  phaser on stun mister worf we dont know whats going on down there no need to take chances,  agreed sir,  remember folks this is a long range transport the effects will be a little unusual,  how do you mean,  understood energize,  wait a minute i dont under ,  you do now,  ohh i know this is crazy but for a moment i felt like i was trapped inside that wall,  you were for a moment,  riker to enterprise,  go ahead number one,  weve arrived in graves home alls quiet so far  on the other hand no one knew we were coming,  use caution and investigate protect graves health at all cost were leaving orbit to assist the mary rogers back as soon as possible,  understood captain riker out,  lets look around  see if anybodys home,  someone is home sir,  you heard me thank god,  im kareen brianon doctor graves assistant are you you with starfleet,  yes were from a ship called the enterprise we monitored your distress call but you never acknowledged our response,  im sorry i couldnt take the chance,  what chance,  the chance that i might find out someone was coming,  kareen knew full well that i would not be pleased,  i had no choice i refuse to stand by and watch you deteriorate,  what symptoms have you noticed,  he has pain shortness of breath irritability ,  well see about that ira i hope one of you is a doctor,  doctor katherine pulaski call me kate,  no offense but i dont want you touching me in a medical way its no secret that i dont like people much and i like doctors even less than people,  funny i always thought doctors were people,  and you were wrong just ask any patient although i will admit for a doctor youre a nice looking woman,  and what have we here another lovely specimen of womanhood,  i thought you didnt like people,  i like women always try to forget that theyre people,  im deanna troi its an honor to meet you doctor graves,  yes yes of course it is this is one of the truly great moments of your life believe me honey youll never meet anyone half as sagacious as me im a phenom,  oh there i go again  shocking people with the truth i can appreciate how hard it is for others to try and keep up with my mind i dont mean to burden with my brilliance it just works out that way,  excuse me sir are you a romulan,  hardly,  hes a klingon kareen kareen has lived here since her father died when she was quite young her only knowledge of inhuman races comes from me i suppose klingons and romulans must look much alike,  do i have to stand here and be insulted,  no insult intended mister klingon see doctor nothing wrong with my hearing ,  my my my,  uh lieutenant commander data sir ,  functional durable obviously no concern whatsoever for aesthetic values,  looks like soongs work,  quite correct sir did you know soong,  know him i taught him everything he knows you could say i was the father of his work which kinda makes me your grandfather doesnt it sonny,  damn doctors always sneaking up on you like that  saying this isnt going to hurt this isnt going to hurt when you both know its going to hurt like hell well im not paying the bill for this,  there wont be a bill doctor may i speak with you privately,  what for anything you think you founds more my business than his,  go on gorgeous whatever the hell it is i can take it,  i checked twice to make certain you have varnays disease,  im sorry ira youre dying and theres nothing i can do about it,  captains log stardate  weve successfully transported the passengers and crew of the stricken liner mary rogers,  tragically six people died in the initial explosion but the rest are now aboard and in good condition we are heading back to gravesworld with great dispatch,  you wanted to see me sir,  yes ensign i assume you would very much like to meet doctor graves,  yes sir his theories on spatial relationships are amazing and his work in thermodynamics is ,  providing his health is reasonably intact im going to appoint you as his personal tour guide when he comes aboard you have the run of the ship  show him anything you think hell find interesting and for heavens sake dont talk his ear off,  yes sir understood but why me sir i mean not that im complaining ,  being difficult and im not sure i have the patience for that right now,  and sometimes the very old get along best with the very young,  id say he has a week but thats a guesstimate,  is he in great pain,  some i could help with that but he wont let me get near him,  he wont even let me get near him now,  has he been like a father to you,  more like a teacher,  i sense that his feelings for you are very warm hes attracted to you in many ways,  attracted i know  ive felt certain feelings from him but hes always been a gentleman had i been older perhaps we couldve been lovers but nothing like that ever happened between us,  now its like hes afraid to face me the only one he talks to is your friend data,  i have noticed doctor that you ,  i have noticed grandpa that you keep repeating the same notes of a musical passage that i am unfamiliar with,  its an ancient little tune called if i only had a heart a rather plaintive lament sung by a mechanical man who longs to be human its his only wish,  what happens to this man,  he finds out that he is human after all always was  just worried so much he never realized it,  a happy ending the mechanical man got his wish,  stories often have happy endings its life that throws you for a loop,  it must be hard for you so close to being human and yet never really knowing what its like to feel pain,  but pain is unpleasant is it not,  pain lust envy pleasure desire do you know what desire is data,  desire it is to long for or crave a wish a request a ,  no i do not suppose i will ever know what it really is,  i feel pity for you your existence is a kind of walking purgatory  neither dead nor alive never really feeling anything just existing just existing,  listen to me  a dying man taking the time to mourn a man who will never know death funny isnt it,  funny i have difficulty discerning what is funny,  ive had the same difficulty most of my life were much alike,  i just spoke with the captain the enterprise is minutes away hell contact us again when she goes into orbit,  you informed him of doctor graves condition,  yes arrangements are being made to make his last days with us as comfortable as possible,  itll be strange to leave here,  youre a beautiful young woman and theres a whole universe waiting for you out there,  ill be alone ill be without ira,  i know what it is to lose those closest to your heart it will be hard you will feel alone at first but it will surely pass as time passes i know,  you mentioned your impending death a while ago i must say grandpa that you are facing it with remarkable courage and stoicism,  that is because i am an incredible man possessing an iron will and nerves of steel two traits that helped me become the genius i am today as well as the ladykiller i was in days gone by,  you condone homicide sir,  its an expression data it means i was once as beautiful as i am smart,  really grandpa,  no not really  but what the hell im dying i can remember my life any way i want,  and ill tell you a little secret sonny i dont think i truly will be dying,  but the doctor ,  ive invented a way of transferring consciousness into a computer before i die i plan to convey my great intelligence into this machine thus cheating the grim reaper of his greatest prize,  grim reaper is that a farmer with no sense of humor,  i speak of the personification of death itself but what do you know of death it is a subject forever alien to you,  well grandpa that is not necessarily true i do have an off button if you like its activation robs me of all consciousness  therefore rendering me dead for all intents and purposes,  it is not something i enjoy contemplating,  i can understand that still the analogy is a good one just where would soong position such a device dont tell me let me guess,  welcome to gravesworld sir this is kareen brianon doctor graves friend and assistant,  im very sorry ms brianon im sure this is quite difficult for you,  thank you captain your people have been most kind to me,  wheres data,  hes been with doctor graves almost the entire time they seem to have developed a genuine rapport,  hmm i suppose i can understand that i think we should immediately transport to the ship there are patients from the rogers who could use some of your medical savvy,  injuries,  nothing serious but id also like to get doctor graves to a place where we can make him more comfortable,  that will not be necessary captain,  explain yourself data,  it happened in my arms just a few moments ago there is no need to hurry ira graves is dead,  captains log supplemental i leave gravesworld with an empty feeling and the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful whatever scientific secrets ira graves was about to unlock will follow him to his grave,  our immediate priority is to reach the nearest starbase so that graves assistant and the marooned settlers can get on with their lives,  and he really believed he could transfer his intellect into a computer,  that is correct unfortunately he never had the opportunity to elaborate death came swiftly,  why didnt you notify doctor pulaski when it started to happen,  to do so would have been pointless there was nothing she could have done,  its probably right my preliminary report indicates an extremely rapid heart stoppage death was almost instantaneous,  i am not an it doctor you have been duly informed of this on several occasions yet you continue to label me with that abhorrent pronoun,  data i realize you liked doctor graves a great deal,  he was the greatest man i have ever known,  does his death disturb you,  disturb captain no all things must pass may i go now sir,  yes of course,  we will try and do the funeral the way he wanted will we not captain,  i told you we would data,  i am glad sir it was his dying wish,  thats interesting,  hmm,  i thought he said death came swiftly when did graves have time to make a dying wish,  perhaps beforehand perhaps he had a premonition,  hello data its good to see you again,  the stars are so beautiful when seen from space yet they seem lonely  each so isolated from the next,  ira never told you how beautiful you were to him he never told you that did he,  he could not tell you do you understand,  yes i understand,  but he wanted to every waking moment and he wanted you to know that,  data how do you know how do you know what he thought of me,  he told me,  captain picard,  what is it,  i heard about the ceremony youre having for doctor graves and well sir ,  since i never got to meet him,  i think its a fine idea come along wes,  seventytwo no make it seventyone degrees and whenever the name ira graves is mentioned it will warm considerably ,  are we the first,  you are the last the others have congregated inside,  very good enter,  perhaps the child would be better off playing somewhere else this is an adult ceremony after all,  the child you still working on your sense of humor data,  you dont seem yourself lately are you feeling all right,  of course sir i am as healthy as a rigellian ox,  we certainly knew of him his reputation spread throughout the galaxy and his mind touched all who cherish science,  we gather here today to say a respectful goodbye to ira ellsworth graves a man who ,  this is not exactly what he wanted,  you programmed the setting the field the mountain range ,  i question commander this was one of his favorite places on gravesworld,  well what is it then,  it is the tone the pacing the content of the verbal tribute no offense counselor but doctor graves would have desired a slightly more personal address,  and how can you be so sure,  why he told me of course perhaps i should take over sir,  if you promise to be brief when i agreed to this i didnt intend for it to interfere with our duties understood,  perfectly,  just look at that face the face of a thinker a warrior a man for all seasons,  yes friends ira graves was all that and more,  ira graves was a great humanitarian,  to know know know him was to love love love him but ira graves was not perfect,  data,  perhaps his greatest fault was that he was too selfless cared too much for his fellow man,  data thats enough,  i am almost finished sir,  you are finished you mean,  whats become of your judgment,  perhaps i am maturing sir,  do you consider it mature to program the mountains to tremble every time you say the name ira graves,  not to mention the air warming at the very thought of him we wouldve been barbequed if wed stayed much longer,  i seem to have overdone it,  to put it mildly,  i brought shame to this ship to the good name of starfleet,  data ,  his wishes to make sure i kept my promise,  i know that data,  look i realize youve been studying the human equation with great alacrity but maybe youve been trying just a little too hard do you know what i mean,  try and relax a little dont try to be so human just be yourself okay,  affirmative sir i will work on staying within myself now if you will excuse me i am due on the bridge,  im concerned sir ive never seen him act like this,  could it be that grandfather analogy graves planted in his head data is an orphan in a manner of speaking maybe the loss of graves really got to him touched him emotionally,  i hope thats all it is,  its captain picard and commander riker may we come in,  weve come to pay our respects miss brianon,  thank you gentlemen thats most thoughtful,  were due at starbase six in less than twelve hours we thought you might enjoy a quick look at the bridge before we arrive,  can one see the stars from up there,  oh yes closer than youve ever seen them before,  i think id enjoy that very much,  that was a great speech data to know know him is to love love love love love him,  taken from a centuriesold earth composition your childlike mind cannot appreciate the timeworn wisdom of its words,  youre not turning into a starcrossed artist on us are you data,  i am many things artist scholar lover genius ,  youre getting funnier i gotta hand it to you theres something to be said for that deadpan delivery,  youre looking in the general direction of the constellation pegasus,  what was that data,  nothing sir nothing at all,  these are our science stations,  whats wrong with you,  i detest hypocrisy i wish they would just come out and admit it,  admit what mister data,  that your interest in kareen is not entirely honorable,  data you are way out of line,  try as you might you cannot win her heart she does not like older men mister data you are hereby relieved of duty  worf take his station,  yes sir,  you will report to your quarters immediately you will not leave there until you hear otherwise from me is that understood,  sure i understand i understand all too well,  removing the competition will not help you picard,  do you know what that was all about,  jealousy i sensed intense burning jealousy and it was coming from data,  i heard what happened but i just cant believe it,  do not trouble yourself friend i am sure the captain will be by to apologize shortly,  you expect him to apologize,  it seems i was too harsh on soong notice the strong chin the finely chiseled features the powerful torso do you realize that this body will never wear out immortality,  what the hell are you talking about,  hes not himself sir i know him better than anybody,  were going to sickbay,  oh are you ill sir,  im getting there come along,  i dont oil machinery,  why dont you take it down to engineering,  because i brought him to you i want a complete medical check run on him immediately,  ill do the best i can ,  i have the utmost faith in your abilities doctor i know nothing will get by you,  im sure theres a reason youre looking at me that way,  i am simply looking any thought of ulterior motive rests with you perhaps you are projecting your own desires,  perhaps not ive had three husbands dear and theyve all been flesh and blood for some strange reason i like it that way now shut up and turn over,  very well it is your loss,  wait for me in the corridor mister data,  what for this concerns me more than it does any of you,  you will wait for me in the corridor,  his insubordination is growing by leaps and bounds i could throw him in the brig but id rather try and help him,  well i really dont know what to suggest physically its fit as a fiddle granted its not easy to examine a tin can the size of a human but ill be damned if i can find anything wrong with it,  perhaps were looking in the wrong place sir,  explain,  well datas physical health may be unimpaired but its his mental health that needs to be addressed,  are you suggesting its losing its mind,  with your permission captain theres one way to find out,  you remember the psychotronic stability examination dont you data we all had to take it before graduating from the academy,  it was a waste of time then and it is a waste of time now,  just watch the screen and let your mind go blank this little machine will do the rest,  its safe to say youre his best friend can you speculate on whats happening to him,  its just a guess sir but well sometimes he wants to be human so bad he can taste it and sometimes he is more human than he or we realize,  yes,  i think your theory might be right captain witnessing graves death may have been the catalyst ,  i have the results of the tests captain i  i ran two tests to make certain,  make certain of what,  there are two distinct personalities within lieutenant commander data,  what hes an android thats not possible,  nevertheless it is true the second personality is the dominant it is unbalanced brilliant but vain sensitive yet paranoid i believe it is also capable of extreme acts of violence,  so thats it,  what was that sir,  nothing go on,  it seems to have an especially strong hatred of you captain or to a lesser degree any authority figure and worst of all its growing,  how do you mean,  the alien persona is getting stronger  gobbling up whats left of the original data,  if we dont find a way to stop it immediately the data we knew will be gone forever,  where is he now counselor,  i left him in his quarters he still has orders not to leave,  orders which personality will choose to obey my orders,  tell me  where is lieutenant commander data,  hello kareen,  you know who i am dont you,  youre  youre data,  you know who i am dont you,  ira,  it is me kareen im here  im alive,  how,  the process worked i turned data off and transferred my consciousness into his frame,  just look at me sleek powerful indestructable,  when i was a boy other children knew i couldnt match them physically they teased me  bullied me thats when i withdrew became an island,  but no one will ever bully me again if they try ill simply break their necks,  dont talk that way ira ive never known you to be violent,  ive never been capable of violence but now im more than capable  and i rather enjoy this new ability,  excuse me data but the captain would like to see you,  of course if you will excuse me miss brianon,  youre just the type arent you youd beat me up if you could but you cant not any more,  ira no,  stay out of it youre lucky im such a compassionate man now walk,  theres something i must do  something theyre forcing me to do ill come for you when my task is complete,  ira i dont understand whats happening to you,  something wonderful i feel no pain no pain at all and im immortal  ill never have to face death again think of the things ill accomplish over the next thousand years,  i know what youre thinking but theres no need to worry ill create an android body for you as well well witness the end of infinity together,  dont cry kareen dont you see i can love you now the way ive always wanted to it wouldnt have been right then i was too old for you too weak but now i can be everything youve ever wanted,  ira  youre hurting me,  ill be back wait for me,  ohhh what hit me,  did data do this,  but its not really data,  yes i realize that now,  security alert  all decks lieutenant commander data may be armed and dangerous use extreme caution and subdue all phasers on stun,  well hello there you all look like you could use a little vacation,  captain picard  i have ordered your people to vacate the bridge and they have refused in an effort to save insignificant lives i will give you the opportunity to issue the same order otherwise i will remove them my way,  that phasers set to kill captain,  data thats your best friend youre threatening thats geordi you wouldnt harm him for the world would you,  geordi,  yes data its me,  hes no friend of mine i should kill him on the spot  put him out of his blind misery,  you win  no need to act rashly mister la forge you and the rest of the bridge crew will vacate immediately,  ill blast anyone who attempts to reenter,  you will make no attempt to recapture the bridge is that clear geordi,  yes sir evacuating now,  maybe i should shoot one in the back just to let you know i mean business,  what is it you want tell me,  kareen is with us you want to talk to kareen,  kareen are you there,  yes  yes ira im here,  theyre all against me kareen they want to drive me out of this body to kill me,  were going to a new world my darling a place where no one can ever touch us just hang on and trust in me,  riker to bridge riker to bridge its no good he deactivated the monitor,  we must remember that were dealing with an unhealthy mind ravaged by varnays disease as well as the strain of assimilating into a new body,  and that unhealthy mind is in total control of this ship,  yet he seems to have a purpose he said something about going to a new world,  do you know what he meant by that,  is there anything you can tell us about ira graves that will help us to understand,  hes a wonderful man hes not like this ,  i want her back are you going to help me,  how can i help,  by rejecting him by deflating his ego,  yes he said he was doing this for you saying you want nothing to do with him might distract him long enough ,  it might be our only hope he controls all lifesupport systems on this ship he could start killing us like flies,  i cant do it dont you understand,  yes i suppose i do understand,  where are you going captain,  to the bridge,  i cant let you do that sir,  you have no choice number one should i fail to return i want you to attempt an external bridge separation get all of our people as far away from him as possible,  you cant just walk in on him he wont hesitate to kill you,  theres still some of data inside i know there is if i can reach him maybe weve still got a chance,  i couldve killed you you know that dont you,  i do know that i also know you havent killed anyone so far i dont think you really want to,  where are we going,  to the aldebaran system theres a planet there that suits my purpose,  which is,  why should i tell you,  because youre lonely because you want someone else to share your plans,  ill tell you because im bored i plan on building a fortress with a laboratory of course those of your crew that i do not exterminate shall live there as our slaves kareen will never want for anything,  and what of data your grandson,  what of him,  you took advantage of him,  i did him a favor i gave him life,  you killed him youre nothing but a twobit murderer,  you call me a murderer ill show you what murder is,  stop it,  youve become a monster,  dont say that kareen he attacked me ,  i hate you i despise you,  kareen dont,  youre not a man anymore youre a pathetic little pile of machinery,  stop please,  the thought of ever living with something like you makes me sick,  id rather live alone id rather make love to a computer,  are you going to kill me too,  you hate me what can i do what can i do,  leave that body it doesnt belong to you,  data data can you hear me,  no questions just tell me a joke the funniest joke in history,  all right there were twelve starship captains sitting on a fence ,  hes in there ira put himself in the computer,  no kareen the real ira graves never left the planet",7
61,i borg,35.23,4.63,9.64,0.95,2.76,15.64,31.14,0.0,0.0,2935.0," captains log stardate  the enterprise is charting six star systems that make up the argolis cluster an area being considered for colonization,  very impressive,  its beautiful and frightening at the same time,  radiation bursts from the stars surface are making precise sensor readings difficult it seems to be exhibiting gravitational instability,  the stars fluctuations are too severe it would be impossible to settle any of the planets in this system,  i suggest we proceed to the next system its sun is a stable main sequence star,  in a moment mister data,  sir i am detecting a transmission emanating from within this system,  what kind of signal,  it is selfrepeating of unknown pattern,  where is it coming from,  a small moon orbiting the fourth planet,  life signs,  indeterminate i am attempting to screen out sensor interference readings are still inconclusive however the moons atmosphere is capable of supporting life,  then it could be a distress call,  helm take us into transport range doctor crusher we need a medical away team in transporter room two,  acknowledged,  im reading one life form very weak signs,  riker to enterprise,  go ahead number one,  weve found the wreckage of a small craft and one survivor,  its a borg,  male adolescent  hes badly hurt,  there is no indication of other borg activity within sensor range,  away team prepare to return to the ship,  we cant leave him here he wont survive,  i think the captain understands that,  then i dont,  the borg usually collect their dead ,  hes not dead ,  and that transmission ,  that transmission we intercepted was probably a homing signal we have to assume theyre on their way,  at least let me stabilize his condition give him a chance of surviving until they get here,  captain,  your concern is noted doctor but any intervention on your part would only alert the borg to our having been here,  im afraid weve already turned that corner,  security measures must be taken before we beam it on board,  standing by,  mister data notify security to prepare a detention cell bridge to engineering,  la forge here,  were bringing a borg survivor on board well need to neutralize the homing signal ,  receiving transmissions of any kind,  ill set up a subspace damping field around the detention cell,  there are four others none survived,  picard to riker,  go ahead enterprise,  were transporting you directly to the detention cell,  i need him in sickbay ,  the cell doctor whatever equipment you need will be brought to you there,  very well,  come,  captain i just wondered if theres anything you wanted to talk about,  i dont think so counselor,  i would have thought that having a borg on the ship would stir some feelings,  i am quite recovered from my experience thank you,  sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are residual effects of the event that linger you were treated violently by the borg kidnapped assaulted mutilated counselor ,  counselor i very much appreciate your concern for me but i assure you it is misplaced,  i have carefully considered the implications of having this borg on the ship i have weighed the possible risks and i am convinced weve done the right thing i am quite comfortable with my decision,  i will certainly avail myself of your help,  lower the force field,  captain the borg is still unconscious,  he suffered massive internal injuries weve got the hemorrhaging under control but some of the implants in his brain were damaged i may have to remove them,  the borg will die if theyre removed permanently their brains grow dependent on the biochips,  perhaps geordi could construct new implants,  they contain relatively straightforward programming interface protocols we have the files we downloaded after your experience sir i think i could manage it,  mister la forge do you have enought knowledge of borg programming to alter the pathways to the root command structure,  im not sure sir the subroutines are pretty complicated id probably have to study their data processing algorithms thats the only way i could trace the access codes,  if we could get to the root command we could introduce an invasive programming sequence through its biochip system and then return it to the hive,  the borg are so interconnected it would spread like a virus,  until it infected the entire collective we could disable their neural network in one stroke,  infected it sounds like youre talking about a disease,  quite right doctor and if all goes well a terminal one,  if this works the way i think it will once the invasive program starts spreading itll only be a matter of months before the borg suffer total systems failure,  comments,  a question what exactly is total systems failure,  the borg are extremely computerdependent a total systems failure will destroy them,  i just think we should be plain about that were talking about annihilating an entire race,  which under most circumstances would be unconscionable but as i see it the borg leave us little choice,  i agree were at war,  theres been no formal declaration of war,  not from our side but certainly from theirs theyve attacked us in every encounter weve had,  they have declared war on our way of life we are to be assimilated,  even in war there are rules you dont kill civilians indiscriminately,  there are no civilians among the borg,  think of them as a single collective being any one borg is no more an individual than your arm or your leg,  how convenient,  your point,  when i look at my patient i dont see a collective consciousness i dont see a hive i see a living breathing boy whos been hurt and who needs help and were talking about sending him back to his people as an instrument of destruction,  it comes down to this we are faced with an enemy that is determined to destroy us and with whom we have no hope of negotiating peace unless that changes we are justified in doing anything we can to survive,  security to captain,  picard here,  the borg has regained consciousness sir,  acknowledged we will proceed as planned,  whats he doing,  trying to find an access terminal so he can interface with the collective he doesnt understand that the signal has been cut off,  hes emitting a homing signal and a second subspace frequency but our damping field is blocking both signals,  hes alone for the first time in his life hes being forced to cope with his environment without the resources of the collective,  he must be hungry,  arrange to feed it,  aye sir,  ill have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there,  if i didnt know better id think he was scared,  i dont think i like this sport,  last week when you scored two touches on me you liked it well enough,  i hear we have a guest on board,  yes,  is that wise,  im not sure i hope so,  i thought i understood you picard but i dont understand this,  it was an errand of mercy he was injured doctor crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him ,  theyll be coming you know that you of all people know that,  shall we go again,  you felt sorry for me look what it got you,  ill have to go in to connect the power conduit,  i will follow the commander reactivate the field once were through,  good now just stay there,  commander,  we are borg,  you will be assimilated,  resistance is futile,  take a look around pal youre not exactly in a position to make demands,  we must return to the collective,  whos we,  we are borg,  theres only one of you,  do you have a name,  a means of identification,  third of five,  there were five on your ship is that it just a number,  it does kind of suit you,  youre welcome,  lets get out of here,  hes hungry all right,  why do you do this,  im just a nice guy at heart feeling better,  you are notborg,  thats right and hope to stay that way,  you will be assimilated resistance is futile,  thats gratitude for you,  ive been rationing his portions of energy i think he understands  if he cooperates he gets fed if not like a rat in a cage,  if im gonna figure out his command pathways i have to learn how he processes information the only way i know to do that is to give him perceptual tests that means getting his cooperation,  so he can participate in the destruction of his entire species,  doctor,  i know i know were at war,  im here to help you but i dont have to like it,  i think were ready to transport him if he gives us any trouble we can access the force field through this console ready,  la forge to transporter room three were ready here,  we are standing by commander,  energize,  you want some,  doctor crusher this is third of five third of five this is our ships doctor,  hello,  what is a doctor,  a doctor heals the sick repairs the injured,  the sick and injured are reabsorbed others take their place,  that didnt happen to you when we found you you were dying i saved your life,  why,  thats my duty to help those who are hurt,  you give us food,  right,  is that your duty,  yeah thats right,  listen third of five doctor crusher here has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants we want to run a few tests see if everything is working okay,  tests,  ill show you some diagrams ask you some questions about them its very simple really,  you will be assimilated,  right but before that happens could we maybe ask you a few questions,  we will answer,  terrific okay third of five right over here,  what is your designation,  designation,  third of five,  you mean our names we dont have designations  we have names im beverly this is geordi,  do i have a  name,  do you want one,  a name,  im beverly this is geordi you,  you,  thats it hugh what do you think,  you,  not you hugh,  hugh,  all right im beverly,  im geordi,  we are hugh,  now imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned inside out,  which one is it,  this one,  thats right hes gotten every one  eight for eight that blows the top right off the spatial acuity percentiles,  its the prosthetic eye it seems to be giving him very complex visual information,  like some kind of holographic imaging system,  that could be helpful,  hugh id like to take a closer look at your eyepiece is that okay,  here,  well thanks,  when you are assimilated you will have a similar device,  hugh do you understand that we dont want to be assimilated,  why do you resist us,  because we dont want to live the way you do,  here it is quiet there are no other voices,  other voices,  on a borg ship we live with the thoughts of the others in our minds thousands of voices with us always,  i think what youre saying is that youre lonely,  here you go,  when you have completed these tests what will be done with us,  well send you home,  we will rejoin the collective,  its funny when i first started out i had no problem with creating this invasive program but the more i work with hugh the more i ,  hugh,  thats the name we gave him,  you named a borg,  yeah it was easier to have something to call him,  okay so now you have a borg named hugh,  and hes not anything like id expected,  how so,  i dont know hes he just seems like a kid a long way from home,  youre the second person today thats talked about this borg as if he were a lost child,  and now im having second thoughts about what were doing programming him like a walking bomb sending him back to destroy the others,  this kids big brothers are going to hunt us down they wont rest until they have him back and theyll destroy us in the process  without any of this soulsearching youre going through,  maybe you should go talk to him it might not seem so clear cut then,  i wouldnt have anything to say,  then why dont you just listen thats what you do best isnt it,  what is it number one,  weve picked up a vessel on long range scanners headed this way,  analysis,  the vessel is traveling at warp sevenpointsix mass twopointfive million metric tons configuration cubical,  the borg,  its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the one that crashed,  interference from the stars radiation will shield us from their sensors we should remain undetected until they enter this system,  how long do we have,  at present speed they will arrive in thirtyone hours seven minutes,  well you dont look so tough,  i hear they gave you a name,  yes we are hugh,  well arent you going to tell me i have to be assimilated,  you wish to be assimilated ,  no i dont wish but thats what you people do,  resistance is futile right,  resistance is futile,  ive got news for you it isnt some of my ancestors resisted the borg when you came to assimilate us a few escaped,  resistance is not futile,  no,  but thanks to you there arent many of us were scattered around the galaxy we have no home we dont even have each other,  what you are saying is that you are lonely,  what ,  you have no others you have no home,  we are also lonely,  what is geordi doing,  just studying the components in your prosthesis,  were just trying to learn more about you,  youre very different from us part of what we do is to learn more about other species,  we assimilate species then we know everything about them,  yeah i know,  is that not easier,  maybe it is its just not what we do,  think about it this way every time you talk about yourself you use the word we we do this we do that you dont know how to think of yourself as a single individual you dont say i want this or i am hugh,  when you sleep there are no voices in your mind,  no,  sometimes but thats why we have friends,  friends,  sure someone you talk to who can be with you when youre lonely who makes you feel better,  like geordi and hugh,  thats it captain,  it looks harmless enough,  we had to disguise it as something innocuous the borg have ways of screening out programming anomalies,  how can a geometric form disable a computer system,  the shape is a paradox it cannot exist in real space or time,  when hughs imaging apparatus imprints it on his biochips hell try to analyze it,  he will be unsuccessful and will store the shape in his memory banks it will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis,  when the borg download his memory theyll incorporate it into their network then theyll try to analyze it,  it is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an anomalous solution the anomalies are designed to interact with each other linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle,  quite original how long before total systems failure,  not until the shape has gone through several hundred computational cycles,  when can you begin the process,  another twenty hours doctor crusher wants to make sure the new implants have taken hold,  very well proceed as soon as youre ready,  captain,  i have to admit ive been having second thoughts about this plan,  for what reason,  well ive been getting to know him the borg,  i see,  hes not what i thought he would be sir he has feelings hes homesick i dont know it just seems wrong to use him like this,  centuries ago when laboratory animals were used for research scientists would occasionally become attached to the creatures that was a problem if the experiment involved killing them i would suggest you unattach yourself from the borg mister la forge,  aye captain,  guinan please come in,  you sure looks like youre all set for a quiet evening,  im delighted to see you would you like something to drink,  no thanks,  i was thinking about how you said my foil was dipping the other day maybe i should do some exercises build up a little strength in my arm,  a strong forearm is always an advantage in fencing,  not to mention tending bar,  about the borg,  arent you just a bit surprised by him,  surprised,  yes did you know he has a name,  la forge gave it to him his names hugh and hes lonely,  i dont know what made me go see him la forge told me i should but i said no,  and then i found myself standing there staring at him curiosity i figured just curiosity,  picard i want to hear you say that youre sure  that what youre doing is right,  if youve come here to persuade me not to use the invasive program,  no  i think im asking you to persuade me,  two days ago you were so upset about the borg even being on the ship that you tore the foil out of my hand now youre here questioning whether he should be treated as an enemy,  i know but when you talk to him face to face can you honestly say you have no doubts,  i havent talked to him,  why not,  i see no need ,  if youre going to use this person its a borg damn it not a person ,  if youre going to use this person to destroy his race dont you think you should look him in the eye once before you do it besides im not so sure he is borg anymore,  because hes been given a name by a member of the crew doesnt mean hes no longer borg because hes young doesnt mean hes innocent he is what he is and in spite of the efforts to turn him into some kind of pet  i will not alter our plans,  fine but unless you talk to him that decision harder to live with than you realize,  worf to captain picard,  yes lieutenant,  we are ready to transport,  proceed,  you may wait outside lieutenant,  locutus,  yes i am locutus of borg,  why are you here,  this is a primitive culture i am here to facilitate its incorporation identify yourself,  identify yourself,  this is not a borg identification,  third of five,  this culture will be assimilated,  they do not wish it,  irrelevant,  they will resist us,  resistance is futile,  resistance is not futile,  some have escaped,  they will be found it is inevitable all will be assimilated,  must geordi be assimilated,  geordi does not wish it he would rather die than be assimilated,  then he will die,  no geordi must not die,  geordi is a friend,  you will assist us in assimilating this vessel,  you are borg you will assist us,  i will not,  what did you say,  i will not assist you,  i ,  geordi must not be assimilated,  but you are borg,  no i am  hugh,  speaking with the borg because i didnt want anything to get in the way of our plan but now something has as far as i can tell he seems to be a fully realized individual he has even accepted me as picard captain of this ship and not as locutus,  then youve reconsidered the plan,  yes if we used him in that manner wed be no better than the enemy we seek to destroy i want other options,  we could return him to the crash site but wed have to erase his memories of being on the enterprise,  but if we erase his memories then who he is who hes become would be destroyed,  isnt that the point hed be reassimilated into the hive without any questions,  it just seems wrong we help turn him into an individual then we take that away from him,  is there a danger that the borg might destroy him  if they discover whats happened,  i doubt it they have nothing to gain by that its more likely theyll simply wipe out his memory of this experience,  then either way his memories will be erased,  but perhaps,  purge those memories the sense of individuality which he has gained here will be transmitted throughout the collective,  every one of the borg will have the opportunity to experience the feeling of singularity perhaps that would be the most pernicious program of all the knowledge of self spread through the borg collective in that brief moment might alter them forever,  we will leave his memories intact,  i have only one question,  what if he doesnt want to go back,  hello hugh,  hello geordi,  hugh a borg rescue vessel is approaching it will be here within three hours we can return you to the crash site where they will find you and take you home,  or if you wish you may remain here with us,  what i wish is irrelevant,  its not irrelevant it matters to us,  no borg leaves the collective if they find i am missing  they will come for me,  hugh well deal with the repercussions later what we must know is what you want,  you are many i am one my needs are not important,  dont you understand were giving you a choice,  choice,  yeah do you want to go back with the borg or stay with us,  i could stay with you ,  yes we would grant you asylum,  choose what i want,  i would choose to stay with geordi,  but it is too dangerous they will follow,  return me to the crash site it is the only way,  hugh think about this are you sure,  yes,  the borg ship will enter orbit of the moon within an hour youll soon be headed home,  well beam him down and take position in the stars chromosphere its interference will hide us from their sensors,  goodbye hugh im very glad i got to know you,  goodbye beverly you saved my life,  its not too late to change your mind you can stay here,  i must return,  captain id like to go down with him,  my experience suggests that they would ignore him would you agree,  the borg assimilate civilizations not individuals,  but captain they kidnapped you,  because they needed a liaison to communicate with humans the borg ignored every away team we sent to their ship including yours doctor,  you may accompany him,  goodbye,  captain i do not want to forget that i am hugh,  energize,  we found you there in the middle of that debris,  then that is where i will wait,  we are now entering position radiation levels are rising,  increase power to the shields hold us here,  status of the borg ship,  solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable at last known course and speed the borg vessel will enter the system in three minutes,  well i guess this is it so long hugh,  goodbye geordi i will try to remember you",9
27,darmok,31.52,26.65,18.09,7.94,6.79,1.29,7.72,0.0,0.0,2709.0," captains log stardate  the enterprise is en route to an uninhabited planet in the eladrel system the location is midway between federation space and the territory occupied by an enigmatic race known as the children of tama,  the tamarians apparently arrived at eladrel four nearly three weeks ago theyve been transmitting a subspace signal toward federation space ever since,  the signal is a standard mathematical progression it does not carry a specific message,  but they want us to know theyre there,  apparently so starfleet believes their presence is an attempt to start a dialogue commander,  federation vessels have encountered tamarian ships seven times over the past one hundred years each meeting was without incident but formal relations were never established because communication was not possible,  why,  the children of tama were called incomprehensible by captain silvestri of the shiku maru other accounts are comparable,  a cause for concern for all we know they are threatening our border,  everything in the previous encounters suggests a peaceable race we have to start from there,  agreed i appreciate your prudence lieutenant worf but given the evidence starfleet has arrived at a reasonable conclusion the tamarians have extended a hand  we must do the same,  the children of tama ive heard rumors about them for years,  as have i number one,  are they truly incomprehensible in my experience communication is a function of patience and imagination id like to think we have both qualities in sufficient measure,  of lowani lowani under two moons jiri of ubaya ubaya of crossed roads at lungha lungha her sky grey,  counselor,  im picking up nothing but good intentions captain,  data,  the tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals and locations,  but what does it all mean,  i am at a loss sir,  captain i invite you to consider the creation of a mutual nonaggression pact between our two peoples possibly leading to a trade agreement and cultural interchange does this sound like a reasonable course of action,  kadir beneath mo moteh,  the river temarc,  impressions number one,  they seem to be trying their best,  as are we for what its worth,  captain,  darmok,  darmok rai and jiri at lungha,  shaka when the walls fell,  zima at anzo zima and bakor,  darmok at tanagra,  shaka mirab his sails unfurled,  mir,  the river temarc,  darmok and jalad at tanagra,  block their transporter with the shields extend to maximum range,  not enough time,  where is he,  the tamarians have transported captain picard to the surface with their own captain,  riker to obrien ,  commander the tamarian ship has created a particle scattering field in the planets ionosphere,  riker to captain picard captain do you read me,  can we compensate,  no sir the tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam into the upper atmosphere the result is a hyperionization that disrupts virtually all em and subspace carriers,  that means they cant communicate with their man either or beam anybody through the field,  that is correct however they have left sensor frequencies clear,  so they can read whats going on analysis mister worf what the hell is going on,  a contest perhaps between champions our captain against theirs,  theirs was armed,  darmok and jalad,  you expect me to fight  is that it a challenge,  i dont know who or what darmok and jalad are but i didnt come here to start a war,  i refuse,  would you attack an unarmed man captain theres not much of a challenge in that,  temba his arms wide,  im sorry captain,  shaka when the walls fell,  sensors show the captain and the tamarian in apparent good health approximately twenty meters from each other,  lieutenant hail the tamarian ship,  on screen,  you are holding our captain i want him released,  darmok at tanagra,  your actions can be interpreted as an act of war,  kiteo his eyes closed chenza at court the court of silence chenza,  is there any way to get through to them,  not without further study,  mister worf close the channel,  gladly sir,  i want you and a security team to take a shuttle down to the planet bring back the captain,  aye commander,  sir the tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle,  im aware of that but disrupting our transporter beam is one thing firing on a shuttle is something else entirely im betting theyre not gonna push it that far,  shaka when the walls fell,  shaka indeed,  what now captain will you attack me in my sleep,  if i dont freeze to death first,  darmok of kanza jalad of the kituay,  picard of the federation,  of the starship enterprise of the planet earth,  kadir beneath mo moteh,  temba,  temba what do you mean fire temba means fire,  temba is a person his arms are wide because hes holding them apart in generosity in giving in taking,  thank you thank you,  first officers log supplemental i am sending a shuttlecraft to find captain picard gambling that the tamarians will back down rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire but i feel like im playing a deadly game  the captains life is the prize and i still dont know the rules,  the positron density is point zero one three electron concentration is seven point ninefive,  we are two hundred fifty kilometers from the planets surface,  the shuttle has reached the e region of the planets ionosphere,  how long can we maintain communications,  the scattering layer induced by the tamarians is concentrated in the upper d region the shuttle will enter that area in approximately two minutes,  the tamarian ship,  unchanged sir they appear to be making no attempt to stop us,  maybe we called their bluff,  status mister worf,  navigational lifesupport propulsion normal onboard systems do not appear to be disrupted by the field but i can barely read you commander,  acknowledged lieutenant maintain contact as long as conditions permit ,  power surge in the tamarian plasma reactor,  mister worf evasive maneuver sequence delta,  commander the shuttle has been hit,  damage,  the starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable,  thats all riker to lieutenant worf,  report,  starboard thrusters destroyed commander i may be able to land i will not be able to take off,  understood lieutenant return to the enterprise,  aye sir,  enough to make them turn back but not enough to hurt them,  yes sir the phaser pulse appears to have been carefully attenuated for just that effect,  nice shooting,  im pretty sure i can punch up the annular confinement beam  enough to transport the captain through the field but its gonna take a full day at least,  captain picard could be dead by then,  i do not believe so,  i have confidence in his ability as a warrior he will be victorious,  youre still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual we cant be certain of that,  agreed were making educated guesses about their motivations then why do we wait if we attack the ship directly they will be unable to maintain the scattering field,  which could start a shooting match and for all we know a war and we still might not be able to save the captain,  it will end this stalemate,  theres too much at risk ill take that course when its the only one left,  who the hell are these people theres got to be some way to get through to them,  as i have said with further study it may be possible to ,  deanna help him i want something by ohnine hundred hours,  where have you gone to my friend,  forgive the intrusion captain but i need some answers,  freeze,  darmok it seems to be a point of contention between them perhaps something the tamarian captain proposed but his first officer didnt like,  the apparent emotional dynamic does seem to support that assumption as with the other terms used by the tamarian it appears to be a proper noun the name clearly carries a meaning for them,  computer search for the term darmok in all linguistic databases compiled for this sector,  searching,  darmok is the name of a seventh dynasty emperor on kanda four,  a mythohistorical hunter on shantil three a colony on malindi seven,  a frozen dessert on razna five a ,  fortyseven,  all our technology and experience our universal translator our years in space  contacts with more alien cultures than i can remember,  i have encountered

think weve got something,  a captains log ,  darmok,  darmok and jalad at tanagra,  i was curious i meant no harm,  shaka,  temba his arms wide temba,  commander sensors are picking up an electromagnetic disturbance analysis,  a variable induction field possibly a lifeform,  how close is it to the captain,  the field is erratic  appearing and disappearing  but it seems to be moving toward him,  attacking,  ill go along with that,  riker to la forge,  la forge here,  how close are we on the transporter,  about two hours  maybe three,  i want the captain out of there now,  thats not likely sir,  i dont want to hear that commander,  whats the resonance frequency,  point three four over standard,  i want a resolution of point five three at the very least ill need two more minutes commander but theres a good chance this isnt gonna work,  if it fails,  i know well have tipped our hand to the tamarians but thats a chance weve got to take,  agreed,  la forge proceed,  were on it la forge out,  riker to transporter room one,  obrien here commander,  stand by mister obrien,  mirab  his sails unfurled,  come on,  darmok and jalad ,  i remember the words but i dont understand,  matrix levels,  annular convergence holding at four three nine point two oh five confinement resolution at point five two seven,  that isnt gonna do it increase thermal input coefficient to one hundred fiftypercent,  increasing now,  status la forge,  were almost there commander shunt the overload to the phase transition sequencers in transporter one,  yes sir,  la forge to obrien,  go ahead commander,  confirm phase sequencer linkage,  link confirmed ready whenever you are sir,  uzani his army at lashmir,  at lashmir was it like this at lashmir similar to what were facing now,  uzani,  his army with fist open,  a strategy with fist open,  with fist open why  to lure the enemy,  his army with fist closed,  with fist closed an army open to lure the enemy then closed to attack thats how you communicate isnt it by citing example by metaphor uzanis army with fist closed,  sokath his eyes uncovered,  no ,  ive got a piece of him commander but thats all,  la forge boost the confinement beam,  one fiftyseven over standard,  its as solid as itll go commander,  the tamarian and the entity are in close proximity the tamarians lifesigns are fluctuating,  the scattering field is still in full force what the hell is wrong with them,  their sensors can read whats going on as well as ours can riker to obrien report,  the fields still deflecting the signal there just isnt enough of him sir,  open a channel to the tamarian ship,  your captain is under attack drop your particle field,  kailash when it rises,  they have closed the channel,  obrien to bridge,  i cant hold him commander,  shaka,  first officers log stardate captain picard back to the ship has failed my options are narrowing and my patience is all but gone,  heres the situation on eladrel the entity has moved off several hundred meters,  captain picards bioscan readings are stable the tamarians are not,  he may have been injured,  if the entity attacks again the captain could be facing it alone,  the transporters completely out of the question the tamarian ship has deepened the scattering field to the d region of the ionosphere theres no getting through,  unless we attack the ship itself,  can you pinpoint the source of their particle beam,  theyre using a polarity coil generator located aft of their warp drive its heavily shielded,  can we get through with our phasers,  not with the first spread itll take a few hits,  thats not good enough i want to be able to knock out the scattering field in one shot and have the captain back on the enterprise before they know what happened,  if we selectively target the amplification pathways around the generator it should be just as effective and we can do it in one burst,  how long to set that up,  worf and i will have to adjust the prefire chambers thatll give us the focus we need a few hours,  get started,  aye sir,  id prefer to find a peaceful solution if we can talk our way out of this  so much the better,  unfortunately its not that simple,  what have you found,  the tamarian ego structure does not seem to allow what we normally think of as selfidentity their ability to abstract is highly unusual they seem to communicate through narrative imagery  by reference to the individuals and places which appear in their mythohistorical accounts,  its as if i were to say to you juliet on her balcony,  an image of romance,  exactly image is everything to the tamarians it embodies their emotional states their very thought processes its how they communicate and how they think,  if we know how they think cant we get something across to them,  no sir the situation is analogous to understanding the grammar of a language but none of the vocabulary,  if i didnt know who juliet was or what she was doing on that balcony the image alone wouldnt mean anything,  thats correct we know for instance that darmok was a great hero  a hunter tanagra was an island but thats all without the details theres no understanding,  it is necessary for us to learn the narratives from which the tamarians are drawing these images given our current relations that does not appear likely,  our situation is similar to theirs i understand but i need to know more tell me more about darmok and jalad tell me,  you used the words temba his arms wide when you gave me the fire and the dagger could that mean give temba his arms wide darmok give me more about darmok,  darmok on the ocean,  darmok,  the ocean,  darmok on the ocean,  a metaphor for being alone isolated darmok on the ocean,  are you alright,  kiazis children their faces wet,  temba his arms wide give me more darmok on the ocean ,  tanagra on the ocean darmok at tanagra,  at tanagra a country tanagra on the ocean an island temba his arms wide,  jalad on the ocean jalad at tanagra,  jalad at tanagra he went to the same island as darmok to tanagra,  the beast at tanagra,  the beast a creature on the island on tanagra darmok and jalad  did they fight the beast,  they arrived separately they struggled against a common foe the beast at tanagra darmok and jalad,  darmok and jalad on the ocean,  they left together,  darmok and jalad on the ocean,  on the ocean,  zinda his face black his eyes red,  callimas at bahar,  you hoped this would happen didnt you you knew there was a dangerous creature on this planet and you knew from the tale of darmok that danger shared can sometimes bring two people together darmok and jalad at tanagra you and me here  at eladrel,  kira at bashi,  my turn im afraid im not much of a story teller and you wouldnt understand me anyway shaka when the walls fell,  perhaps that doesnt matter you want to hear it anyway,  there is a story a very ancient one from earth ill try to remember,  gilgamesh was a king at uruk he tormented his subjects he drove them to anger they cried out  give our king a companion spare us his madness,  enkidu a wildman of the forest entered the city they fought in the temple they fought in the street gilgamesh defeated enkidu they became friends gilgamesh and enkidu at uruk,  at uruk,  the new friends went into the desert where the great bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds enkidu caught it by the tail gilgamesh struck it with his sword,  they were victorious but enkidu fell to the ground struck down by the gods,  and gilgamesh wept bitter tears saying he who was my companion through adventure and hardships is gone forever ,  first officers log supplemental i have no choice but to break the stalemate if war is the result maybe it was inevitable perhaps the distance between our races is so vast that nothing else was ever possible,  phasers are nearly ready sir,  stand by to fire mister worf,  commander the tamarians bioscans have become unreadable he may be dead sir,  if we know it  so do the tamarians riker to la forge,  la forge here,  i need those phasers ,  sir  sensors are tracking the entity it is approaching captain picards position,  i understand your sacrifice captain,  unfortunately if our friend out there has its way no one will ever know what you tried to do,  nine meters and closing commander,  six meters,  la forge to bridge you have phasers,  fire,  their particle beam emitters are inoperative,  the scattering field is down,  obrien energize,  we got him commander,  maximum shields,  aye,  red alert,  starboard shields holding at fiftytwo percent forward shields gone,  lets get out of here,  that will not be possible commander the starboard nacelle sustained a direct hit warp engines are offline,  go to impulse back us off,  they are matching our maneuver and firing,  return fire mister worf full phasers,  firing sir,  their shields are holding they are firing again,  our shields have failed,  commander  we cannot survive another hit,  hail the tamarian ship,  aye captain,  zinda his face black his eyes red ,  the river temarc in winter,  darmok,  sokath his eyes open,  the beast at tanagra uzani his army shaka when the walls fell,  picard and dathon at eladrel,  mirab with sails unfurled,  temba his arms open,  temba at rest,  thank you,  new friends captain,  i cant say number one,  but at least theyre not new enemies,  come,  i hope im not intruding captain,  not at all number one please,  damage reports are ready for your review,  thank you,  greek sir,  the homeric hymns one of the root metaphors of our own culture,  for the next time we encounter the tamarians,  more familiarity with our own mythology might help us relate to theirs,  the tamarian was willing to risk all of us  just for the hope of communication of connection and now the doors open between our peoples that commitment meant more to him than his own life,  would i do the same ",9
153,the vengeance factor,31.3,34.17,12.57,3.13,2.66,15.39,0.78,0.0,0.0,1917.0," someone sure stripped this place,  the reactor is gone,  thats why no one answered our hail for two days  they had nothing to answer it with,  life signs five meters straight ahead commander,  blood,  yes but not human ill have to do some analysis on it,  its jammed,  the two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns id guess several hits each,  several when one would surely have sufficed,  itll take us a while to bring them around but theyll recover,  we found a sample of blood its a rare ironcopper composite unique to one humanoid species the acamarians,  acamarians that would suggest the gatherers,  a likely hypothesis the nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as gatherers have raided other outposts in neighboring sectors,  but theyve never ventured this far before,  and we cannot permit them to spread their violent ways further mister crusher set course for the acamar system,  aye sir,  captains log stardate 9 in an effort to put an end to the gatherer raids we have come to the acamar system to enlist the aid of marouk the sovereign of acamar three,  their raids have made this sector unsafe our research facilities have been ransacked trade routes disrupted,  the gatherers are elusive weve only managed to capture a handful of them however with starfleets help,  hunting them down is not what im proposing,  reconciliation with the gatherers is impossible its been tried every time weve offered amnesty theyve rejected it,  when was the last attempt made,  eighteen years ago,  eighteen years,  yes we gave up trying,  why,  because the gatherers arent willing to change for almost a century theyve been parasites moving from star system to star system living on what they could find or steal theyre little more than barbarians,  they are still your people,  no captain you have to understand our history a hundred years ago before the gatherers split off from our culture we were a savage violent race clans battled clans bloody vengeful feuds that lasted for generations but we overcame those ways broke the cycle of fighting and revenge all except the gatherers,  after a century of wandering they may be ready to come home,  despite all your progress your society is still divided and it will remain so until the gatherers return to acamar,  the attempt may be futile,  you have much to gain and little to lose in making the effort the problem affects us all it cannot be ignored,  sovereign marouk how soon will you be ready to leave acamar,  i am ready now captain i need only bring aboard two more servants,  ill see to that and to your accommodations sovereign,  i have reason to believe there is a gatherer encampment somewhere in the hromi cluster,  mister data,  the federation has charted but not explored several class m planets in that area any of those planets might well serve as a base,  mister crusher set course for the hromi cluster,  aye sir,  a fine ship commander,  were very proud of her,  yuta ,  a light meal in twenty minutes,  may i be shown to the kitchen commander,  youre the chef,  yes ill prepare all meals for the sovereign and her servants,  we can provide you with a kitchen if you wish but its not really necessary the food dispensers can synthesize anything you want,  ill show you sovereign may i offer you a drink,  yes thank you cold water,  a glass of water five degrees,  please,  youre also the food taster,  thats part of the cooks duties,  im sure the sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines your ship has to offer but there are certain acamarian dishes she will insist upon,  ill arrange for a technician to help you program your recipes into the computer id like to try some myself whats your specialty,  i have none,  dont be modest you cant tell me you havent come up with a few original triumphs,  there is a spiced parthus dish,  parthus,  a green vegetable with fleshy roots,  chef,  entering standard orbit of gamma hromi two sir,  i am detecting life readings on the surface sir and several small areas of heat and carbon dioxide emission indicative of combustion,  campfires data,  its worth a look,  make it so,  artonian lasers tonkian homing beacons quite a collection,  noranium alloys their salvage value is low,  looks like the gatherers arent very discriminating in what they steal,  the spoils of animals without honor,  commander,  ambush,  rigellian phaser rifles not very powerful,  powerful enough,  we want to talk ,  your words are wasted commander they understand only this,  were here to establish a dialogue,  data noranium vaporizes at ,  two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees of course noranium carbide alloys vaporize at a slightly higher temperature,  phaser setting seven ought to do it,  now,  enterprise  four to beam up energize,  cowards,  your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed more often,  weve brought the sovereign of acamar,  marouk here,  with an offer of amnesty,  full dispensation will be extended to all gatherers who are willing to return to acamar three,  you dont trust me,  should i,  oh but you expect me to trust you perhaps you just poisoned it yourself,  taste it,  barbarians this is futile,  sovereign,  go home old woman,  brull,  you people havent changed in a hundred years,  you were there you should know,  sit down,  we are here to talk,  it is a waste of time captain they dont care how they live,  and i am supposed to believe that you do care how we live,  yes,  she is here isnt she brull,  perhaps you forced her,  nobody forces me anywhere brull nobody,  what is there for us on acamar three,  a life a home you can end your wandering your miserable existence,  do i look miserable,  the clan wars are over brull it is a past we are ashamed of it is why you had to leave now it is time to come home,  any insights counselor,  brulls ready to negotiate he wants privacy so he wont appear weak in the presence of the other gatherers,  you are of the clan lornack,  so,  ive seen you before,  yes,  but its impossible,  no look closer,  i am yuta ,  i am the last of my line but my clan will outlive yours,  marouks offer has value still im not sure,  but you agree its worth presenting to your leader,  chorgan is a better judge of such things i will go to him you will hear from me in twenty days,  brull in twenty days i hope to be very far away from here,  with all due respect brull i would like to make the offer to chorgan myself,  we will gladly take you with us aboard the enterprise it will give you a chance to enjoy federation hospitality how many of your men do you want to accompany you,  ill come alone if this is a trap ,  it isnt,  mallon  youll take charge while im gone if i dont return in ten days ,  brull,  away team to enterprise medical emergency,  volnoth was an old man theres nothing to be done,  theres a chance our doctors can do something,  you found him,  yes and there are no other members of the lornack clan here so i claim his possessions,  granted,  have you no respect for the dead,  whats there to respect about a corpse,  hes been dead too long,  how,  cardiac arrest,  you dont sound convinced,  no it was a heart attack all right but i cant figure out what caused it cardiac muscle is strong no sign of arterial occlusion,  is there anything you need to bring with you brull,  like what,  anything a change of clothes perhaps,  no i just changed into these recently,  very well then picard to enterprise two,  my quarters are to be just as big as hers,  brull  show mister crusher the course to plot,  a child,  that child is one of the finest ensigns under my command he also happens to pilot this ship,  that does not inspire my confidence but if you want me to show him ill show him,  this is our present position,  then set a heading of threefour three mark seventwo,  thatll take us through the center of an asteroid belt,  whats the matter  cant you fly your way around a couple of rocks,  sure i can but if we take this heading and we only lose twelve point one minutes at warp seven,  have it your way,  for centuries my planet was in chaos loyalty to ones clan was absolute and the slightest injury to one member demanded violent retaliation,  and these blood feuds could last for decades,  the obsession for vengeance would be passed on from generation to generation and with each act of retribution the violence would escalate,  its not unlike the history of my own planet marouk,  your pardon sovereign may i be excused briefly commander riker requested i prepare him an acamarian dish,  of course yuta,  what are you doing,  my studies,  what is this,  math,  i can see that whats it mean,  its the locally euclidean metrization of a kfold contravariant riemannian tensor field,  you good at it,  you dont like me,  i didnt say ,  thats no problem i have many friends that dont like me what do you know about me,  youre a thief,  i do it to survive  not because i enjoy it,  and we gatherers value freedom we do as we want and answer to no creature,  but youre helping sovereign marouk to change all that,  maybe i just want something better for me and for my children,  you have children,  two sons ones almost your age hes not so good at math,  parthus a la yuta,  with the help of one of your food stations,  its wonderful,  truly excellent,  thank you,  will you join us,  i dont want to intrude,  not at all i was just about to leave please  sit down,  it really is delicious,  i am glad it pleases you commander,  im not your commander my name is william,  i will call you william if you prefer,  i do you say commander to me the same way you say sovereign to marouk,  as a servant,  youre an excellent commander but youd make a poor sovereign,  whys that not that i disagree,  youre not comfortable with servants,  no i prefer the company of equals,  so you treat me as an equal,  and youre not comfortable with that,  im not used to it ive always been a servant im not complaining  the sovereign treats me well i have all that i could want,  what about freedom,  i can never have that,  youre the property of the sovereign,  no im not her slave i can leave whenever i wish,  but you have no place to go,  just the opposite my path is all too clear,  yuta youre an excellent cook but you talk in riddles,  ive never been very good at conversation,  i think the sovereign wants me to return enjoy the parthus,  sickbay to commander riker ive discovered something interesting will,  ill be right there,  doctor youre scowling,  im thinking,  and,  the old gatherer on the planet ive found what caused his heart attack,  the medical tricorder almost missed it but there was a microvirus in his body it attached to parasympathetic nerves and acted as a cholinesterase inhibitor blocking autonomic nerve impulses,  and that stopped his heart,  but heres the interesting part the microvirus will only attach to cells which contain a very specific dna sequence,  how specific,  without knowing more about their genetic makeup i cant be sure but my guess is this virus would only kill one acamarian in a million,  thats an awfully singleminded bug,  too singleminded i cant believe its a naturally occurring virus,  meaning somebody engineered it,  meaning volnoth was murdered,  sir acamar three has agreed to your request for access to its databases they are now transmitting them to our computer over subspace link,  good notify doctor crusher when acamars medical database is online riker out,  come in,  im disturbing you,  not at all,  as the sovereign has no further need of my services this evening she suggested i might spend some time with you,  what a charming suggestion,  she appreciates the affection was it so obvious,  well ive already dined but maybe you know a good acamarian dessert recipe,  does that please you,  tell me what you want william i will do anything you wish,  youve got the night off remember,  i dont understand,  you dont want me to give you pleasure,  not as a servant i told you i prefer equals,  even in matters of love,  especially in matters of love,  ive offended you,  no,  i only want to make you as happy as you want to make me youre entitled to that,  no im not,  yuta,  i do not feel pleasure or passion i havent been able to for a long time,  i dont know who did this to you or why but it can change,  i wish it could tonight most of all im sorry,  your people have provided a warm welcome,  thats chorgans ship,  shields holding,  worf  contact chorgan and tell him brull has brought us here to talk,  chorgans not responding,  mister worf can we knock out their shields without seriously damaging their ship,  i believe we can sir,  prepare phasers and open channel,  phasers locked channel open captain,  this is jeanluc picard,  lets focus their attention fire,  their forward shields are inoperative,  well done lieutenant,  theyre hailing us sir,  thats better on screen,  brull  you traitor you led them here to destroy me ,  chorgan if i had wanted you destroyed you wouldnt be talking now,  obviously i want something else,  and what is that,  i have on board sovereign marouk of acamar three i want you to hear what she and brull have to say,  its worth listening to her chorgan,  i dont wish to hear either of you,  you have no choice prepare to receive us  were coming aboard your ship picard out,  cancel red alert have sovereign marouk meet me in transporter three,  aye sir,  youre going alone captain,  the danger is minimal number one chorgans not likely to do anything rash while the enterprises phasers are trained upon his ship,  its still a risk,  for these negotiations to succeed i must be a mediator  not an enforcer,  you have the bridge number one,  chorgan may i introduce sovereign marouk,  you may sit,  i think you will find marouks proposal ,  you know picard  i could take you prisoner,  dont worry ive no intention of doing so youve gone to a lot of trouble to get here  im curious why,  then lets proceed,  quite simply i propose amnesty for every gatherer,  amnesty you mean slavery,  chorgan if you want to know what i think,  i dont say what you came to say but i tell you right now i doubt that ill believe it,  i didnt believe this very persuasive federation captain when he suggested that we could reconcile our differences but i am convinced now it is the right thing not just for you but for us too we need you back,  ive brought some acamarian brandy im sure its been a long time,  you have spent a century hunting us down ,  shes trying to put an end to that,  by luring us back and putting us in prisons,  no  by accepting you back as free men,  and will you feed and clothe us too,  no of course i wont what i will do is give you the means to feed and clothe yourselves weve already set aside land you can,  do we look like farmers to you,  then dont farm use the land as you wish it is yours and the moment you set foot on it youll be better off than you are today you wont be running any longer,  we would need autonomy,  autonomy,  let us acknowledge sovereign that chorgan appears willing to discuss your offer,  there are many levels of autonomy certainly your region would have home rights,  those rights will be spelled out before i agree to anything,  commander im afraid the only entry on volnoth in the acamarian database is a birth record,  probably one of the last of the gatherers to be born on their planet,  ive been digging through the medical database from acamar three for hours and ive found another victim of the microvirus that killed volnoth but just one,  fiftythree years ago a gatherer named penthormul,  data  got anything in your files on this penthormul,  yes he was captured while leading a gatherer raid on an acamarian outpost he died of a heart attack before his trial ended commander he was a member of the lornack clan,  display volnoths birth record again,  lornack the same clan,  the only two recorded deaths from this microvirus members of the same clan what does that tell us doctor,  if these microbes were engineered for murder id say somebodys going after the whole family,  commander chorgan the present leader of the gatherers is also from the lornack clan,  i want to know just how this clan was involved in the acamarian blood feuds any clues to their enemies you can find how could this virus be transmitted,  more ways than i can count and its perfectly safe to the carrier as long as he doesnt have the same dna patterns,  tailor made for their victims,  sir eighty years ago the lornacks massacred a rival clan the tralestas it ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years,  ended it,  according to these records there were no survivors the tralesta clan was annihilated,  something tells me they may not have all been wiped out,  theres got to be a missing link here,  computer any members of the acamarian delegation in the tralesta clan,  clan affiliation is not within provided records,  commander i believe i have found a correlation between the two deaths your missing link ,  that is penthormul being led from his trial,  i dont see the connection,  behind him to the left sir,  computer scan left and magnify,  the computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face sir,  do it,  but the photograph was taken over fifty years ago,  fiftythree years and she hasnt aged a day,  three seats on the ruling council,  if were going to be subject to your laws we want a part in making them,  i agree youre entitled to representation but not on the ruling council,  unacceptable the real power is in the council youre trying to shut us out already ,  no  youre trying to take too much no group has three seats on the council,  i dont care what others have ,  yes  you only care about what you can take,  sovereign  were the situation reversed you would be demanding the same levels of representation,  youre right captain i apologize for my temper,  perhaps a short pause would be helpful,  i agree excellent thought yuta,  its quite remarkable how much alike the two of you actually are,  im being quite honest both able negotiators strong leaders,  we dont obey weak leaders,  we have nothing at all in common we have agreed to nothing,  wrong chorgan weve agreed to have some brandy together,  treachery a federation trap ,  dont move,  yuta move away from chorgan,  do it,  why,  because of a man you once knew penthormul,  pentharmul how do you know pentharmul,  he was murdered fifty years ago,  murdered  thats not so he died of,  he was killed just as volnoth was by a deadly virus designed to attack your clan,  what do you mean designed by whom ,  tell him yuta,  you were with penthormul when he died,  if it was fifty years ago how could i,  i know yuta,  stop chorgan  keep perfectly still your life is in danger,  yuta  step back,  william this is not your concern,  it is now youre about to commit murder,  it isnt murder its justice,  who are you,  yuta of the clan tralesta,  there are no more tralestas,  five survived the last lornack raid but on that day a century ago my life ended and my search began i was the one chosen transformed my cells were altered my aging slowed enough to finish my task,  murdering innocent people  is that your task,  hes not innocent hes a lornack,  you used me in order to get to the last few you couldnt reach,  yes sovereign,  youll never leave this ship if i dont kill you myself my men will,  you are the last once youre dead what happens to me doesnt matter,  yuta the wars are over,  you cannot understand,  no i cant youre right because ive seen the part of you that regrets what you have become yuta listen to me you dont have to do this any more,  i have no choice,  you do,  william i ,  im sorry,  dont ,  commander im in your debt,  new orders from starfleet,  the rendezvous with the goddard has been postponed,  and in the meantime,  starbase three four three were to take on medical supplies for the alpha leonis system,  sounds pretty routine,  with the gatherer truce in effect it should be we wont require a full ships complement im going to extend shore leave on the starbase to anyone who wants it,  ill pass that along to the crew captain,  parthus a la yuta",6
9,attached,30.38,26.44,3.82,3.88,0.97,34.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,3404.0," captains log stardate  the enterprise has arrived at kesprytt three in order to evaluate an unusual request on the part of the kes for associate membership in the federation,  shes been very secretive every time i ask her about it or try to edge around the subject she changes the subject personally i think shes in love,  mmmmm,  didnt you hear me i said shes in love,  yes,  is that all you can say,  what would you like me to say im very pleased for them both,  both of who,  the two people we were discussing,  you dont have the slightest idea who im talking about do you,  no no im sorry but i really dont,  ill try not to take that personally ive been talking about nurse ogawa and ensign markson for almost fifteen minutes,  oh now it hasnt been that long,  how would you know you havent heard a thing ive said since i got here,  youre right im sorry,  are you worried about this mission with the kes,  not worried exactly just uneasy this notion of admitting half of their planet to the federation while leaving the other half out,  well first of all the kes are not half the planet theyre almost threequarters of it and the prytt are not being left out  they simply dont want any outside contact with the federation or anyone else,  every member of the federation has entered as a unified world and that unity said something about them that they had resolved certain social and political problems at home and were ready to join a larger community,  from all indications the kes are a very unified very progressive people,  but the prytt are not they are reclusive to the point of xenophobia,  think about earth  what if one of the old nationstates say australia had decided not to join the world government in twentyone fifty would that have disqualified us from being a federation member,  that analogy is not entirely ,  riker to captain,  go ahead number one,  weve received word from ambassador mauric that hes ready to see you and doctor crusher,  inform him were on our way,  acknowledged,  thank you for breakfast,  wait until tomorrow i have something very special planned its a vulcan dish  thats all ill tell you,  captain doctor i have the coordinates of ambassador maurics chambers,  lets not keep them waiting mister worf,  enterprise to kes security relay station one were ready to commence transport,  acknowledged enterprise we have lowered our defense shield,  confirmed,  energize,  this is security relay station one we are ready to receive your captain and medical officer,  this is the enterprise we have completed the transport sequence you should have them,  negative enterprise they are not here,  beverly beverly,  what happened,  i dont know,  the last thing i remember was beginning the transport,  i would assume that were on kesprytt in some kind of prison cell,  the question is why i cant imagine that ambassador mauric would ,  jeanluc,  what is it,  im not sure,  its an implant looks like it might be connected directly to the brainstem,  some kind of coercive device ,  whatever they are i doubt theyre designed for our health,  why are we being held,  if you tell us why youve taken us hostage we might be able to ,  you are not hostages you are prisoners,  prisoners by whose authority,  you are being held under the authority of the prytt security ministry the charge is conspiring with the enemy,  the enemy you mean the kes,  we are not fools we are aware of the federation attempt to establish a military alliance with the kes it will not be tolerated,  your information is in error there are no plans to enter into any ,  there is no point in trying to mislead us captain the devices which have been implanted in your cerebral cortexes will soon be calibrated to your psiwave patterns at that time we will get all the information we need,  and you will discover that were telling the truth,  we shall see,  there is nothing wrong with the transporter i have run a complete diagnostic and checked all the targeting components,  then what happened to the captain and doctor crusher,  commander the transporter sensor log shows an unusual concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil these particles do not occur naturally  something must have interfered with the transporter,  interfered,  a concentration of antigraviton particles would suggest a tractor beam it might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set of coordinates,  is there a way to locate those coordinates,  no sir however it may be possible to determine the point of origin of the tractor beam itself,  well thats a start,  the tractor beam originated from somewhere within the prytt alliance,  the prytt things just got a little more complicated can we scan for them,  prytt territory is shielded by a highenergy forcefield it cannot be penetrated by our sensors,  why would the prytt want captain picard and doctor crusher,  i dont know and its not going to be easy to find out the prytt have consistently refused all outside contact and somehow i dont think theyre going to be eager to start now well have to work through the kes contact ambassador mauric and tell him we need a meeting right away,  aye sir,  what,  what,  youre staring at me,  sorry i was just wondering how long you were going to keep at this,  as long as it takes with any luck there may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape,  right,  the important thing during any confinement is to think positively and not to give up hope there is a way out of every box there is a solution to every puzzle it is simply a matter of ,  damn,  well at least this means were not going to starve to death,  what it means is that they plan on keeping us here for a while,  im starting to think negatively jeanluc,  my tricorder,  does it work,  yes but somethings been added to the main directory,  its a map,  an escape route that guard must be working for the kes,  possibly,  what else could it be,  it could be part of a very carefully laid trap,  if you ask me id rather take my chances out there,  agreed is there a way to open the cell door,  yes the codes been entered,  on behalf of my government i would like to take this opportunity to present our profound apologizes to you regarding this unfortunate incident,  thats very kind ambassador but i dont think anyone here blames you or the kes government for whats happened,  our primary concern is not to assign blame but to recover our missing officers,  of course we are prepared to insert a hostage rescue team into the prytt capital city on three hours notice,  ambassador we havent even tried a diplomatic effort yet id rather not use force until weve exhausted all other options,  i dont believe we have any diplomatic options commander there are no formal relations with the prytt surely you must have some means of communication in case of a planetary emergency,  we have never had need of such a system,  we can determine their communications frequencies and establish a link,  allow me to be blunt the prytt are a fanatical xenophobic people with little regard for civilized discourse even if you do establish a communications link with them it will be a complete waste of time,  how long has it been since your last diplomatic contact,  almost a century,  then its possible that theyve changed over the years,  we have had other less formal contacts with the prytt  contacts that i cannot discuss but i can assure you they have changed very little,  mister ambassador with all due respect i feel i should make an attempt to communicate with the prytt before i sanction the use of force,  of course commander in the meantime i will continue to make preparations for a rescue attempt,  agreed,  i do have one request we believe that the prytt obtained their information about the transport of your captain and doctor through a breach in our communications network if i could set up a base of operations here on the enterprise i would feel much more secure,  mister worf will help you,  thank you,  you first,  is there a problem ambassador,  probably not i am simply securing the area,  i can assure you there is no need,  im sure youre right as security chief of the enterprise i would be glad to assist you in any way possible ,  theres no need well take care of everything thank you lieutenant,  someone obviously put a lot of time and effort into this,  it might have been the guards personal escape route,  youre assuming hes a kes agent,  seems logical,  there must be a lava flow or a hot spring somewhere near by,  its a lava flow about thirty meters beneath us were supposed to head this way,  i smell gas,  this whole chamber is filled with pockets of a methanogenic compound,  can we get through it,  i think so,  what did you say,  i didnt say anything there seems to be a fairly regular pattern to these eruptions if were careful we should be able to navigate through them,  say when,  now,  the eruptions have stopped,  the gas is building up,  i have scanned the entire prytt communications system and i believe this is the primary access module for the central government,  can you determine which of these com links is connected to their prime ministers office,  i believe so however the prytt have no link designed for extraterritorial communications our hail may come as a surprise to them,  well theyre going to have to adjust open a channel,  this is prime minister horaths headquarters how can i be of service,  this is commander william t riker of the federation starship enterprise i know this is an unusual way to ,  the enterprise you mean the ship in orbit,  thats right,  why are you on this comlink,  well we didnt know how to contact your government directly so we had to start somewhere now if i could talk with your,  did you get authorization for this communication from the security ministry,  no as i said we didnt know how to contact you so,  i cannot participate in an unauthorized communication,  not very friendly are they,  no sir,  sir we are being hailed it is the prytt security council,  looks like we got somebodys attention on screen,  enterprise this is security minister lorin you will immediately cease all attempts at communication with our people,  minister weve been trying to contact someone in your government it appears that youve detained two of our officers and we would like to discuss this situation,  there is nothing to discuss if you do not terminate these transmissions we will be forced to take aggressive action against your ship,  their weapon systems pose no threat to the enterprise,  just the same lets keep the shields up for the time being,  is there a problem commander,  our efforts with the prytt just ran into a wall,  i am sorry but perhaps this will brighten your spirits  we have freed your captain and doctor,  what,  they were being held in a prison just outside the prytt capital one of our operatives was able to arrange their escape,  where are they now,  they should be en route to the kes border our operative provided them with a detailed map and instructions on where to go,  how do you plan to get them across the border,  at the moment that information is confidential but trust us we do have a plan,  ambassador im afraid i must insist that you provide us with more information,  i understand your concern of course but i would feel more comfortable discussing operational details in a less public environment,  certainly we can step into the ready room,  i would prefer the quarters you provided me theyre safer,  all right,  theres no way out of here,  maybe we took a wrong turn,  me too,  im thirsty too,  i didnt say anything about being thirsty,  i heard you you said im very thirsty,  i was thinking about it but i didnt say anything,  you were thinking it,  the transceivers lorin said they would align themselves to our psi wave patterns,  the implants might be transmitting our thoughts what am i thinking,  i cant hear your thoughts either maybe it was just a fluke,  for now im afraid we have more immediate concerns does the map indicate a way out of here,  yes we go up,  theres a ledge about thirty meters up that connects to another tunnel which should lead to the surface,  right,  i heard that they werent words exactly i suddenly had this sense of fear a fear of heights,  so much for it being a fluke,  what a strange sensation your thoughts just appeared in my mind,  if you sensed fear of heights you sensed pretty accurately,  come on weve done this before its just like on the holodeck one handhold at a time nothing too fast just a slow gentle climb,  i see youve done some redecorating,  just a few pieces of equipment we needed for security reasons you understand,  certainly,  he is all right,  ambassador how do you plan to get my people out of prytt territory,  you must realize that what i am about to tell you cannot leave this room for some time now we have had certain friends among the prytt citizens who have realized that the long struggle between our two peoples can only end when the prytt government is made to see reason,  youve recruited a few prytt spies,  a crude but accurate term these friends will be waiting for your captain and doctor when they reach the village of ohnkor near the kes border the map we provided your officers will take them to a tavern there,  forgive me ambassador but is it wise to send two human fugitives in starfleet uniforms into a prytt village,  the danger is minimal our operatives control most of the town,  once they have made contact with captain picard and doctor crusher our friends will escort them across the kes border,  id still feel better if they could rendezvous with your operatives in a less public place,  commander i assure you we know what were doing we have a great deal of experience in dealing with the prytt and we would hardly risk the safety of your people after all  were still hoping youll recommend our entrance into the federation,  one of us is hungry,  that would be me,  try to think of something else youre making me hungry,  what would you like me to think about,  something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup,  my grandmother used to make it with beans and peas and carrots ,  beverly,  sorry,  i am not being unreasonable,  i didnt say you were i may have thought it but theres a difference,  youre right we cant react to every random thought that crosses the other persons mind its astonishing how much clutter there is in our consciousness odd memories coming to the surface bits of halfremembered songs,  stray daydreams scattered minutiae i wonder how true telepaths sift through it all how can they get to what someones really thinking if their minds are constantly churning all this flotsam to the surface,  i just wanted to see if you were listening,  i think the link is getting stronger,  maybe we should put some distance between us that might weaken it not that im tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts,  certainly not,  jeanluc,  what happened,  i dont know i suddenly felt a wave of nausea,  me too,  i dont see anything wrong with either of us maybe the air is toxic,  the same thing but when you moved back toward me i felt better,  it would seem were stuck with each other,  whats wrong,  i cant tell if were supposed to go over this hill or that one the topography on this map is a little vague,  let me see,  you dont really know do you,  youre acting like you know exactly which way to go but youre just guessing do you do this all the time,  no but there are times when its important for a captain to give the appearance of confidence,  im sorry im sorry i couldnt resist,  im beginning to realize that you seem to always have some acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue,  at least ive trained myself not to say it anymore when i was a little girl my mouth was always landing me in trouble with my parents my teachers,  your friends and someone named tom norris ,  thats right we had one date which i brought to an abrupt halt with the words is that a beard or is your face dirty,  or is your face dirty,  theres something more youre laughing but you actually feel embarrassed about that incident,  yes i thought i was being cute but i really hurt him,  that was a long time ago and it taught me a valuable lesson,  this sharing of thoughts and feelings its compelling in a strange way,  very wed better get going,  i dont think so either maybe theres another way to reach the village,  no wed have to backtrack several kilometers to find another way over this ridge,  the borders only two kilometers east of here theres a forcefield protecting it but well have to find a way to deal with that when we get there,  all right,  is something wrong,  have a seat,  captain picard and doctor crusher did not show up at the designated rendezvous point,  do you know what happened to them,  no we have no idea what happened to them we find it strange that your officers would follow the escape plan so precisely  but then fail to make a crucial rendezvous with our operatives,  it is possible they have been recaptured,  our sources would have informed us instantly if that had happened but of course if they werent captured if they simply made a different rendezvous we might not ever know about it,  a different rendezvous im not sure what you mean,  of course youre not you wouldnt know if your captain and doctor were meeting secretly with the prytt meeting in order to set up a military alliance with the federation,  it was a clever scheme first you pretend to lose your officers during transport then you ask us for help and get us to expose several of our undercover operatives in the process but what you didnt expect was for us to get your people out of prison so quickly they needed more time more time to plot the destruction of the kes with their new prytt friends,  this is ridiculous youre starting to see conspiracies everywhere we were invited here by the kes why would we want to ally ourselves with the prytt,  why indeed,  you can believe what you want were going to find our people with or without your help,  then i believe its time for us to be leaving the enterprise,  just make sure you take all that junk with you,  no luck,  im beginning to think theres not a single thing on this planet we can eat,  well if were lucky well be back on the enterprise by this time tomorrow and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and fork,  remember that vulcan dish i promised you for breakfast i was just thinking,  thats not true,  yes it is as soon as i said breakfast i heard you say i hate that,  thats not quite what i meant,  well what did you mean,  i simply dont like,  no no its just that i feel breakfast should be a simple meal and recently they seem to have become more elaborate,  tea and scones thats all you really want isnt it tea and scones why didnt you say so,  it didnt seem that important,  you dont like those elaborate meals either,  i usually prefer something simple myself but somehow i thought you might enjoy more variety,  well its tea and scones for both of us from now on,  i love firelight,  i love firelight,  theres something about the flame the smell of the smoke ive always felt its intoxicating in a way,  i remember when jack and i took wesley on his first camping trip to balfour lake wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire to watch them pop jack kept telling him,  jeanluc i heard you dont push it away,  beverly please i dont want to talk about this right now,  when i said jack and i i could feel this sudden wave of something i never knew you felt that way,  didnt you,  i guess i always knew there was an attraction between us right from the start but i had no idea how strongly you felt why didnt you ever tell me you were in love with me,  you were married to my best friend at first it seemed like a harmless infatuation something more hormonal than emotional but then,  but then as the months went by and the three of us starting spending more time together,  i began to realize that it was something more it wasnt right and i knew i wouldnt act on it but i couldnt help the way i felt,  and when jack died you felt guilty,  i felt guilty before he died having those kind of feelings for my best friends wife then later after the accident i told myself that no matter what happened i would never let you know how i felt,  you didnt want to feel as if you were,  betraying my friend,  thats why you didnt want me on the enterprise seven years ago,  i didnt know how i would react but gradually i found that i didnt feel that way anymore that twenty years was indeed a long time,  and now were friends,  yes friends,  we still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow we should get some sleep,  ambassador thank you for coming,  commander,  were about to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all hail minister lorin please,  enterprise i have warned you about these unauthorized communications,  yes i know but i think its about time we all sat down together and tried to work this out i have ambassador mauric here and ,  that is your misfortune we have nothing to say to either of you,  commander i know youre working with the prytt putting on a little show like that for my benefit does neither of us any good,  well see mister worf,  i think theres someone waiting for us in the observation lounge,  i should have known that anyone willing to deal with the kes would be capable of such an outrage,  im sorry i had to resort to these drastic measures minister but you left me little choice,  dont pretend that the two of you are enemies it is too late for a charade,  if that is an attempt to hide your military alliance with the federation you neednt bother i already know far more than you can imagine,  lets all just sit down and try to talk about whats happened to captain picard and doctor crusher,  i will not sit at a table with him,  no more than i would sit with her,  all right then well stand the important thing is that we start talking,  i am not authorized to talk with a kes official,  then talk to me where are my officers,  as if you dont already know,  im all right,  we are already aware of your plan to use federation technology to build new attack satellites you will find that we are prepared for them,  an interesting if pointless lie i would rather discuss your own plans to use federation aid to stage a takeover of kolrod island,  we have been over this before kolrod clearly belongs to the prytt who originally,  thats it,  i can see that diplomacy is not going to get us anywhere today and i dont have time for an extended negotiation session so its time to lay all the cards on the table,  that means its time to stop fooling around and get serious youre concerned that the kes are about to be admitted into an associative membership with the federation,  correct,  as first officer of the enterprise i think i can promise you that is not going to happen the kes will be denied membership,  you do not have the authority to do that despite whatever games you may have played with the prytt since your arrival we still plan on taking our petition directly to the federation council they will listen to our,  they will listen to the report of the enterprise captain and his first officer and i can tell you right now that the first officers report will go something like this kesprytt is a deeply troubled world with social political and military problems that it has yet to resolve the kes although a friendly and democratic people are driven by suspicion deviousness and paranoia in the opinion of this officer they are not ready for membership,  now to the matter of our missing officers,  they are still charged with spying commander i have heard nothing here which would alter that,  then maybe you should consider this if anything happens to them starfleet is going to want a full investigation that means more starships will be sent to kesprytt and those ships are going to want answers which means theyll be putting your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope,  remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorization well think of what itll be like when ten starships start looking for answers theyll be contacting hundreds of your people theyll conduct massive sensor sweeps they might even start sending down away teams and all because you wouldnt help me find my missing officers,  i think i can use the tricorder to setup a multiphase pulse that should weaken the field enough for us to get through,  im going as fast as i can,  minister we have the human female the male is standing in kes territory,  very well transmit their coordinates to the enterprise transporter room,  understood,  thank you minister now if youll excuse me,  mauric is determined to take his protest to the federation council but i dont think hell get very far,  i tend to agree number one,  did i miss something,  i know i know youre absolutely right,  that was wonderful,  my pleasure,  dont take this the wrong way jeanluc but im glad were not joined at the hip anymore,  were you getting tired of my company,  just tired of bumping into you every thirty seconds i was beginning to feel like you were part of my uniform,  champagne ,  what shall we drink to,  our freedom,  freedom,  penny for your thoughts,  i was just thinking that as distracting as it was i was beginning to get used to hearing your thoughts,  so was i it was very intimate,  you know last night i woke up,  oh,  i was awake for several hours and thanks to the implant i got to hear some very interesting dreams of yours,  a man cant be held responsible for what his mind does when hes asleep,  what about when hes awake,  so now that weve had this unique experience what do we do now,  what do you mean,  you know exactly what i mean,  no i dont the implants been removed remember,  i mean now that we know how we each feel perhaps we shouldnt be afraid to explore those feelings,  im not afraid but im also not ready,  goodnight,  goodnight",7
